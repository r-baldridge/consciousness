## Overview
Blindsight consciousness represents one of the most compelling examples of dissociated visual processing, providing crucial insights into the relationship between perception and awareness. This review synthesizes foundational discoveries, current theoretical frameworks, and emerging research directions.

## Historical Foundation

### Seminal Discoveries

**Larry Weiskrantz and Patient D.B. (1974-1986)**
- **First systematic documentation of blindsight**
- Patient D.B. with V1 lesion showed preserved visual abilities without awareness
- Established forced-choice paradigms for unconscious vision testing
- Demonstrated above-chance performance in "blind" visual field regions

**Key Findings:**
- Accurate discrimination of orientation, motion, and simple patterns
- Correct pointing to invisible targets
- Preserved eye movement responses to visual stimuli
- Complete denial of visual experience in affected regions

### Early Theoretical Frameworks

**Dual Visual System Theory (Schneider, 1969; Trevarthen, 1968)**
- **Tectal vs. cortical visual processing**
- Superior colliculus mediates spatial localization
- Cortical areas mediate pattern recognition
- Provided initial framework for understanding blindsight mechanisms

## Core Theoretical Frameworks

### 1. Dorsal/Ventral Stream Theory
**Key Researchers:** Ungerleider & Mishkin (1982), Goodale & Milner (1992)

**Core Principles:**
- Dorsal stream: "where/how" pathway for action guidance
- Ventral stream: "what" pathway for object identification
- Blindsight primarily affects ventral stream consciousness
- Preserved dorsal stream enables unconscious visuomotor control

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Accurate reaching and grasping to invisible objects
- Preserved spatial navigation abilities
- Intact motion detection and tracking
- Impaired object recognition and identification

### 2. Subcortical Visual Processing Theory
**Key Researchers:** Cowey & Stoerig (1991), Leh et al. (2006)

**Core Principles:**
- Alternative visual pathways bypass damaged V1
- Superior colliculus receives direct retinal input
- Collicular-pulvinar-cortical connections enable processing
- Subcortical structures mediate unconscious visual responses

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Preserved pupillary light responses

### 4. Global Workspace Theory Applications
**Key Researchers:** Lamme (2006), Block (2007)

**Core Principles:**
- Consciousness requires global information integration
