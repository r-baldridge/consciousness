### Consciousness Form Directories
Each consciousness form has its own numbered directory with standardized subdirectories:

#### Category 1: Phenomenal / Qualitative Forms
- **01-visual/** - Visual consciousness (color, shape, motion, depth)

- **04-olfactory/** - Smell consciousness
- **05-gustatory/** - Taste consciousness
- **06-interoceptive/** - Internal bodily state awareness
- **07-emotional/** - Feeling states and affective consciousness

#### Category 2: Levels / Degrees of Awareness
- **08-arousal/** - Basic wakefulness and vigilance
- **09-perceptual/** - Awareness of specific external stimuli
- **10-self-recognition/** - Self-other distinction and "I" sense
- **11-meta-consciousness/** - Thinking about thinking
- **12-narrative/** - Autobiographical self-story construction

#### Category 3: Functional / Theoretical Sub-components
- **13-integrated-information/** - IIT Φ computation and information integration
- **14-global-workspace/** - Global broadcasting and access consciousness
- **15-higher-order-thought/** - HOT theory implementation
- **16-predictive-coding/** - Bayesian inference and prediction

- **25-blindsight/** - Visual processing without phenomenology
- **26-split-brain/** - Hemispheric consciousness separation
- **27-altered-state/** - Psychedelic, meditative, anesthetic consciousness

## Subdirectory Structure
Each consciousness form directory contains 4 standardized subdirectories corresponding to the task framework categories:

### `/info/` - Information Collection & Analysis

- **Purpose:** Literature reviews, empirical data, theoretical frameworks
- **Contents:**
  - Research papers and citations
  - Neural correlate studies
  - Theoretical model comparisons
  - Experimental findings
  - Cross-species studies (where applicable)

### `/spec/` - Technical Specification
**Corresponds to Tasks B4-B7 per consciousness form**
- **Purpose:** Detailed technical design specifications
- **Contents:**
  - Input/output interface definitions
  - Processing mechanism algorithms
  - Neural correlate mappings
  - Qualia generation methods
  - Data flow specifications
  - Computational requirements

### `/system/` - System Integration
**Corresponds to Tasks C8-C11 per consciousness form**
- **Purpose:** Integration with other consciousness forms and overall system
- **Contents:**
  - Inter-module communication protocols
  - Hierarchical dependency mappings
  - Temporal dynamics specifications
  - Global integration strategies
  - Conflict resolution mechanisms
  - Synchronization requirements

### `/validation/` - Implementation & Validation

### Progress Tracking Files:
- **tasks-completed.md** - Status of all 15 tasks for this consciousness form
- **dependencies.md** - Required inputs from other consciousness forms
- **outputs.md** - What this form provides to other consciousness forms

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation Forms (Priority Order)
1. **08-arousal/** - Basic consciousness gating mechanism
2. **13-integrated-information/** - Core integration framework
3. **14-global-workspace/** - Information broadcasting system
4. **09-perceptual/** - Basic external awareness

### Phase 2: Sensory Forms
1. **01-visual/** - Most complex sensory modality
2. **02-auditory/** - Temporal processing and speech
3. **07-emotional/** - Affective integration

### Phase 3: Higher-Order Forms
1. **11-meta-consciousness/** - Self-reflection capability
2. **10-self-recognition/** - Self-other distinction
3. **12-narrative/** - Temporal self-continuity

### Phase 4: Specialized Forms
- All remaining consciousness forms (18 total)

## Usage Instructions

### Starting Work on a Consciousness Form:
1. Navigate to the appropriate numbered directory
2. Begin with `/info/` subdirectory - literature review and research
3. Progress through `/spec/` - technical specifications
4. Continue to `/system/` - integration design
5. Complete with `/validation/` - implementation and testing

### Cross-Form Dependencies:
- Check `dependencies.md` files to understand prerequisite consciousness forms
- Update `outputs.md` when specifications are complete
- Use standardized interfaces defined in `/spec/interface-spec.md`

### Integration Points:
- All forms must integrate with **08-arousal** (consciousness gating)
- Most forms will interact with **13-integrated-information** and **14-global-workspace**
- Higher-order forms depend on lower-level sensory and perceptual forms

## Tools and Standards

### Documentation Standards:
- Markdown format for all documentation
- Consistent section headings across similar documents
- Cross-references using relative links

## Success Criteria

### Per Consciousness Form:
- All 4 subdirectories populated with complete specifications
- All 15 core tasks documented and implementation-ready
- Clear integration points with other consciousness forms defined
- Testable validation framework established

### Overall Project:
