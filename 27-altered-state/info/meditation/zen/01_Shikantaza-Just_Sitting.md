# Shikantaza Just Sitting

Shikantaza

Just‑Sitting

1. What

shikantaza

actually is

Aspect Description

Literal meaning

Just sitting (Japanese

shikan‑taza).

Core attitude

Open, non‑directed awareness. No object, no mantra, no visualisation. The mind is allowed to be exactly what it is, without trying to change it.

Traditional lineage

Popularized by the Sōtō founder Dōgen

Kigen (1200‑1253) in his Shōbōgenzō essay Zazen‑shin
(True Nature of Sitting). Dōgen writes that zazen is the very expression of Buddha‑nature.

Place in Zen

Considered the most direct embodiment of the direct transmission outside scriptures. It is the practice that is the teaching, not a means to a separate goal.

2. Step‑by‑step guide (beginner → intermediate)

2. 1. Preparation Choose a quiet space
 a room with minimal foot traffic, soft natural light, and a stable temperature.
Set a timer  start with

minutes; gradually extend to 30‑45

min as the body adapts.
Wear comfortable, loose clothing
 avoid anything that restricts breathing or circulation.

2. 2. Posture (the five‑posture model)

Element How to achieve Why it matters

Head

Chin slightly tucked, crown relaxed, eyes half‑closed (soft gaze toward the floor about 1

m ahead).
Prevents visual distraction while keeping the nervous system relaxed.

Spine

Straight, natural curve; imagine a string pulling the crown upward.
Aligns the respiratory diaphragm, supports alertness, and prevents drowsiness.

Shoulders

Drop them away from ears; arms rest on thighs, palms up or down (your choice).
Releases muscular tension that otherwise fuels mental agitation.

Hands

Cosmic mudra: left hand palm up, right hand resting on top, thumbs lightly touching, forming an oval.
Symbolically unites the two halves of the self; physically provides a subtle focal point.

Legs

Choose a stable seat: full lotus, half‑lotus, seiza (kneeling on a cushion), or chair with feet flat. The key is stability without strain.
Grounding the body mirrors grounding the mind.
2. 3. Breath & Body Awareness Natural breathing
 do not control the breath; simply notice the sensation of air entering and leaving the nostrils or the rise/fall of the abdomen.
Anchor  the breath is not a meditation object to be held onto; it is a reference point that gently pulls the attention back when it wanders.

2. 4. The just‑sitting mindset

Situation Recommended response

Thoughts arise

Acknowledge: thinking (or feeling, planning, etc.) and let the label dissolve. Return to the open field of awareness.

Emotions surge

Notice the bodily feeling (tight chest, heat, etc.). Label the emotion briefly, then stay with the sensation without trying to suppress or amplify it.

Sensory input (sound, smell)

Hear or smell, note it, and let it become part of the background. Do not chase it.

Restlessness / sleepiness

Adjust posture slightly (straighten spine, open eyes a bit wider) and remind yourself that the practice is not about forcing alertness but about allowing the mind to settle on its own.
2. 5. Closing the session Gently lift the gaze, stretch the arms overhead, roll the shoulders.
Take a few deep breaths to reintegrate with the outer environment.
## Reflect briefly

(optional): What quality of mind was most present?  gratitude, calm, curiosity, etc.

3. Psychological & phenomenological mechanisms

Mechanism How it works in shikantaza Contribution to liberation

Attentional de‑reification

By refusing to latch onto any object, the mind learns that thoughts, feelings, and sensations are transient events rather than solid realities.
## Undermines self‑grasp

(the illusion of a permanent I), a core cause of suffering.

Meta‑awareness

The practitioner constantly observes the process of noticing, creating a second‑order awareness that watches the first‑order flow of experience.
Provides the clear light that Dōgen calls shikaku
(the eye of the mind), exposing emptiness directly.

Neuro‑plastic relaxation‑alertness balance

Open monitoring maintains the default mode network
(DMN) at a low baseline while keeping the salience network engaged enough to prevent drowsiness.
Leads to long‑term reduction of habitual rumination and heightened present‑moment clarity.

Reduction of conceptual overlay

Without a chosen object, the mind cannot build narratives; it stays in the raw sensory field.
Allows the suchness ( tathatā) of each moment to appear uncolored, a prerequisite for seeing reality as it is.

Cultivation of bodhicitta (compassionate intention)
As the practitioner experiences the interdependence of all mental events, the boundary between self and other thins.
Generates the altruistic motivation that fuels the bodhisattva path, turning insight into ethical action.

4. How shikantaza leads to liberation (theoretical trajectory)
Initial stage  Stabilization

The body settles; the mind becomes less fragmented.
Immediate benefit: reduced anxiety, clearer perception.
Middle stage  Insight (kenshō)

The habitual I‑thinking weakens; moments of non‑duality appear (a sense of nothing‑else‑here).
The practitioner may experience a kenshō flash: a direct glimpse of emptiness.
Deepening stage  Integration

Insight is no longer a rare event; it becomes the default background of experience.
Actions in daily life reflect the same openness cultivated on the cushion.
Final stage  Full liberation (nirvāṇa/moksha)

The mental afflictions (greed, aversion, ignorance) have been exhausted.
The practitioner lives continuously in suchness; suffering ceases because there is no longer a self to suffer.

Key point: In Zen, liberation is not a future destination you arrive at after a certain number of sessions. It is the uncovering of a state that has always been present, hidden by conceptual overlay. Shikantaza is the most straightforward method for removing that overlay.

5. Common pitfalls & how to refine the practice

Pitfall Why it happens Remedy

Trying too hard
 treating the session as a performance.
The mind equates effort with achievement, reinforcing the ego.
Remind yourself: There is nothing to achieve.
Keep posture relaxed; if tension rises, gently soften the shoulders.

Sleepiness  especially in the evening.
Low stimulation + closed eyes can trigger the brains sleep centers.
Sit upright, open eyes slightly, or practice kinhin
(walking meditation) for a few minutes before returning.

Blank mind misconception
 believing the mind should be empty.
## Confuses emptiness

(absence of inherent self) with void (nothingness).
Notice whatever arisesthoughts, sounds, sensationswithout trying to push them away. The blankness is the space between them.

Over‑reliance on counting breath

Turns open monitoring into a focused technique, which can become a new object of attachment.
Use counting only as a temporary aid when the mind is wildly scattered; drop it as soon as stability returns.

Physical discomfort
 pain in knees, back, or neck.
## Poor alignment or insufficient support.

Adjust posture, use cushions/bolsters, or switch to a chair. Remember the body is a gate; a painful gate blocks the mind.

Intellectualization
 narrating the experience internally.
The habit of labeling everything turns the practice into a mental lecture.
When you notice inner commentary, label it simply (thinking) and let it dissolve.

6. Suggested progressive schedule (12‑week starter)

Week Session length Focus

min daily
Establish posture, breath awareness, basic labeling.

min daily
Extend duration; begin to notice the space between thoughts.

min daily Introduce brief kinhin (5

min) after sitting to integrate movement.

min daily Practice open‑monitoring without any labeling; simply be.

9‑10

min daily Add a weekly long session (45

min) to test endurance.

11‑12
30‑35

min daily Begin informal daily life integration: bring the same open awareness to washing dishes, walking, etc.

7. Quick checklist for each session Quiet space, timer set.
Stable posture (head, spine, shoulders, hands, legs).
Natural breath observed.
Open, non‑directed awareness maintained.
Labels used only as brief signposts, then released.
End with gentle stretching and a moment of gratitude.

TL;DR (for the impatient
Shikantaza = Just sit, open‑monitor, no object.

Mechanism: De‑reifies thoughts, builds meta‑awareness, balances alertness‑relaxation, reveals emptiness.
Path to liberation: Stabilize → glimpse insight (kenshō)
→ integrate → fully free of self‑grasp.
Common traps: Trying too hard, sleepiness, blank‑mind myth, physical pain, intellectual chatter.
Fixes: Relax, adjust posture, keep eyes slightly open, use brief labeling only when needed.
Give it a try for ten minutes tomorrow, and let me know how the first session feels. Ill be happy to troubleshoot any difficulty or move on to the next technique when youre ready.
