# Tonglen Giving And Taking

10. Tonglen

Taking

and

Giving

Meditation (Adapted for Zen)

What

Tonglen

means in the Zen context

Aspect Description

Literal translation

Tibetan

གསོལ་བ

( gsól ba)
sending and receiving, often rendered as
taking in suffering, sending out relief.

Zen‑specific framing

Zen traditionally emphasizes non‑attachment and compassion (karuṇā). Tonglen is a skillful means
(upāya) that concretely trains the bodhisattvas two wings: wisdom (seeing emptiness) and compassion
(acting for the benefit of all). In a Zen setting the practice is presented as mindful breath work that transforms the usual inhale‑exhale pattern into a counter‑current flow of suffering/relief while maintaining the open‑monitoring stance of shikantaza.

Historical lineage

 Mahayana  The Bodhisattva‑vow texts (e.g., The Bodhisattva

Vow

¡¶ÆÐÈø½ä±¾¡·, 5th

c.) describe the ideal of receiving the pains of sentient beings and offering them happiness.  Tibetan Buddhism  Formalized by Atisha (980‑1054) and later by Tsongkhapa (1357‑1419) in the Lamrim genre.  Zen crossover
 Early Chinese Chán masters (Mazu, Hongren) used the phrase  receive the worlds suffering
 in oral instructions. Modern Zen teachers (e.g., Thích

Nhất

Hạnh, Shōhaku

Okumura) have incorporated Tonglen into sesshin as a complement to shikantaza and metta.

Primary purpose

Transform aversion into compassionate openness. 2.
Actualize the bodhisattva vow by directly training the mind to take the suffering of others. 3.
Deepen insight: recognizing that the suffering we take in is empty and merely a mental label, thereby revealing emptiness. 4.
Balance the breath: the inhale becomes a receptivity to pain; the exhale a generous outflow of relief.

Step‑by‑step protocol (beginner → intermediate)

2. 1. Preparation Quiet space
 cushion or chair, dim lighting, optional incense.
Timer  start with

minutes, then increase to

minutes as you become comfortable.
Posture
 the standard five‑posture model (head, spine, shoulders, hands, legs).

2. 2. Breath‑anchor & intention Three deep breaths to settle.
Set intention (silently): With each inhale I receive the suffering of all beings; with each exhale I send them ease and freedom.

2. 3. Core Tonglen cycle

Phase
Action (synchronized with breath)
What to notice

a. Inhale (receive)

Imagine drawing in the pain, grief, illness, or fear of a specific person, a group, or all sentient beings. Visualize a dark, heavy mist entering the lungs.
Feel the weight of the mist in the chest/abdomen; notice any natural resistance (tightness, aversion).

b. Hold (optional)
Pause for one breath while the mist is inside. Observe the mental label
(suffering) without trying to change it.

c. Exhale (send)

Transform the dark mist into bright, warm light (or a gentle breeze) and radiate it outward toward the target(s). Visualize the light expanding from the heart to the whole body, then outward.
Feel a sensation of expansion
(softening chest, open throat).

d. Return to neutral

Resume normal breathing for a few cycles, simply observing any residual sensations.
| Notice the calm that follows the exchange. | Repeat the cycle for the entire session. |
| --- | --- |

2. 4. Scaling the practice

Scale How to apply

Personal suffering

Begin with your own pain (e.g., anxiety)
→ inhale it, exhale relief. This builds confidence before extending outward.

Specific individual

Choose a loved one or someone you feel conflicted about; direct the inhale/out‑exhale toward them.

Group/All beings

Expand the visualization to all beings everywhere. Use the phrase
All beings, everywhere, receive my breath of relief.

## World‑events (news, disasters)

When you encounter distressing headlines, pause and perform a quick 3‑cycle Tongue
(inhale suffering, exhale relief) before returning to daily tasks.
2. 5. Closing Three deep breaths (normal, not visualized).
Gently open eyes, stretch, and offer a brief gratitude
(e.g., May all be free from suffering).
## Optional journal

 note the object of the practice and any notable sensations or emotions (single sentence).

Psychological

Phenomenological

mechanisms

Mechanism How it operates in Tonglen Why it matters for liberation

Compassionate re‑appraisal

The inhale reframes suffering as something you can hold rather than avoid. This reduces the automatic threat response (amygdala activation).
Weakens aversion, a core poison, and opens the heart to karuṇā.

Counter‑conditioning of breath

Normal breath is neutral; pairing it with receiving and sending creates a new associative network
(ventral striatum) that links respiration with altruistic intention.
Makes compassionate action a habit, not a sporadic effort.

Interoceptive integration

Feeling the mist in the chest engages the insula, deepening body‑mind unity.
Aligns with Zens teaching that the mind is embodied; the insight of emptiness becomes somatically grounded.

Cognitive dissonance reduction

Actively sending relief while receiving pain resolves the mental split between I am safe and others suffer.
Facilitates the non‑dual view that self and other are interdependent, supporting the no‑self insight.

Neuroplastic shift in DMN

Repeated compassionate breathing lowers default‑mode network activity (studies on loving‑kindness meditation).
Diminished self‑referential chatter clears the way for shikantaza ‑type open awareness.

Path

from

Tonglen

to

## Liberation Stabilization

 Breath‑synchronised visualization steadies attention.
## Compassionate immersion

 Taking in suffering creates a direct encounter with the three poisons (greed, aversion, ignorance) in a safe container.
## Insight gap

 When the mind no longer clings to the dark mist as a real entity, a spacious emptiness opens (kenshō‑like).
Integration  Because the practice is action‑oriented
(sending relief), the insight translates immediately into ethical behavior, reinforcing the bodhisattva path.
## Full liberation

 The habitual impulse to protect the self dissolves; the practitioner rests naturally in a boundless compassionate awareness that simultaneously knows emptiness and expresses boundless love.

Common

Pitfalls

Corrective

Strategies

Pitfall Why it happens Remedy

Feeling overwhelmed by the darkness
 inhaling too much imagined suffering.
The mind can amplify the visualized pain.

Scale down: start with a thin wisp of mist, or begin by taking in your own mild discomfort before expanding outward.

Forcing the light
 trying to generate a vivid, powerful exhalation.
Over‑effort creates tension, counter‑productive.

Allow the exhale to be gentle; imagine a soft breeze rather than a blaze.

Getting stuck on a specific persons wrongdoing  resentment blocks the flow.
Aversion resurfaces as mental chatter.

Label the feeling (resentment) and return to the breath; optionally shift the target to all beings to dilute personal bias.

Rushing the cycle
 performing many rapid breaths.
Time pressure or impatience.

Slow the breath (46

seconds per inhale/exhale) and extend dwell time on each phase.

Physical tension in chest/shoulders
 holding the mist too tightly.
Emotional resistance manifests physically.

Relax the shoulders, keep the chest open; if tension spikes, pause the visualization and simply observe the breath for a few cycles.

Clinging to the pleasant after‑glow
 treating the calm as a goal.
The mind seeks reward.

Label the calm (peace) and remind yourself that all states are impermanent.

Practicing without guidance
 misinterpreting the symbolism.
Lack of context can lead to confusion.

Join a short group session or  to a recorded guided Tonglen (e.g., Thích

Nhất

Hạnhs audio) to calibrate the imagery.

## TL;DR (for the impatient Tonglen

= compassionate breath practice: inhale imagined suffering, exhale relief.
Mechanisms: compassionate re‑appraisal, counter‑conditioning of breath, interoceptive integration, cognitive dissonance reduction, DMN down‑regulation.
Path to liberation: calm → take in suffering → realize its emptiness → experience a spacious gap → integrate compassionate action → rest in boundless, non‑dual awareness.
Pitfalls & fixes: overwhelm (scale down), forcing light (keep gentle), personal resentment (label & shift), rushing (slow breath), chest tension (relax shoulders), clinging to peace (label it), solo confusion (use guided audio or group).
Progressive schedule: start with self‑suffering (5

min), expand to individuals, groups, all beings, then practice after news items; optional retreat for deeper integration.

## Try it now: Set a

5‑minute timer, sit in your usual posture, and begin by inhale‑receiving a thin wisp of dark mist that represents your own current stress. Exhale‑sending a soft, warm light that spreads from your heart outward. When thoughts arise, label thinking and return to the breath. After the timer, sit quietly for a minute and notice any shift in openness or compassion.
