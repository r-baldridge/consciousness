Matsuoka

Roshi ( ËÉù¡¡É®µv,

1998)

A Japanese Sōtō‑Zen master who spent most of his adult life teaching in the United States, Soyu

1. Early Life & Training

Year Event

1918

Born in Ōita Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan.

1936‑1942

## Entered Sōji‑ji

(the head temple of the Sōtō school) as a novice monk. Studied under Rev.

Kōshō

Fujii and later under Rev.

Kōshō

Matsumoto.

## Received shiho

(formal dharma transmission) from Rev.

Kōshō

Matsumoto, becoming Roshi (teacher).

1946‑1950

Served as jūshoku‑roshi (resident abbot) at Kōshō‑ji in Fukuoka, overseeing monastic training and lay outreach.

2. Move to North America

Year Milestone

Invited by Rev.

Shunryu

Suzuki Roshi (San

Francisco Zen Center) to give a guest sesshin in California.

Accepted a permanent teaching position at
Soto Zen Mission of the Pacific Northwest in Seattle, Washington.

Established the Seattle Zen Center (later renamed
Seattle Soto Zen Buddhist Temple).

Began traveling regularly to Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, British Columbia, founding satellite groups that eventually became independent temples.

## Co‑founded the

## Northwest Soto Zen Association

(NSZA) to coordinate training, ordination, and publishing among the growing number of centers.

Retired from day‑to‑day administration but continued to give monthly teishos (formal Dharma talks) and annual sesshins at the Seattle temple until his death.

3. Teaching Style & Core Themes

Aspect Description

Language

Delivered talks in simple, colloquial Japanese with English translations provided by senior students; emphasized plain‑spoken Dharma that anyone could grasp.

Practice Emphasis

Shikantaza
(just‑sitting) was the central meditation method; he discouraged excessive reliance on koan study, reserving it for advanced practitioners.

Lay Integration

Frequently addressed the challenges of working‑life practitioners, offering guidance on bringing mindfulness to everyday tasks (e.g., driving, cooking, office work).

Ethics & Compassion

## Highlighted the Four Immeasurables

(loving‑kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, equanimity) as the practical expression of the sutras in a Western context.

Humor

Known for a dry, wry sense of humoroften ending a serious talk with a light anecdote about his own clumsiness in the kitchen.

4. Major Contributions Institution Building
 Founded three enduring Zen centers (Seattle, Portland, Vancouver) that remain active today and have each spawned additional satellite groups.
Teacher Training  Developed a two‑year residential training program
(including monastic precepts, chanting, and intensive sesshin) that produced a generation of American‑born Soto teachers (e.g., Rev.

Ken

Kobayashi, Rev.

Masa

Sato).
Publishing
 Oversaw the printing of a bilingual edition of The Shōbōgenzō excerpts (1974) and a collection of his talks titled Living Zen in the West
(1979). Both remain in circulation among North‑American Soto communities.
Inter‑lineage Dialogue  Hosted joint retreats with Rinzai and Kwan

Um teachers, fostering a climate of mutual respect among the different Zen schools in the Pacific Northwest.

5. Legacy & Continuing Influence

Area Ongoing impact

Sangha

The
Seattle Soto Zen Buddhist Temple still Roshi

Matsuoka as its founding teacher; his portrait hangs in the main meditation hall, and his anniversary is commemorated each October

with a special teisho.

Lineage

All teachers who received shiho from him belong to the Matsuoka‑lineage of Soto Zen, recognized by the Soto Zen Buddhist Association.

Literature

His talks are frequently quoted in contemporary Soto publications (e.g., The Heart of Soto Zen by Rev.

Ken

Kobayashi, 2005).

Social Engagement

## Inspired the

## Seattle Zen Community Food Bank Project

(started 1984)  a volunteer‑driven effort that distributes food to homeless families, reflecting his teaching that practice extends beyond the cushion.

International Relations

Maintained a lifelong correspondence with Sōji‑ji in Japan, helping to arrange exchange visits for American monks to train in Japan and vice‑versa.

6. Selected Quotations (translated)
When you sit, you are not trying to become anything; you are simply allowing what is already present to be seen.

A mind that clings to the past is like a boat that refuses to leave the dockit never experiences the rivers flow.

Compassion is not a feeling you add on top of meditation; it is the natural temperature of a mind that has learned to sit without resistance.

TL;DR Soyu

Matsuoka

Roshi
(1918‑1998) was a Japanese Sōtō‑Zen master who transplanted the tradition to the Pacific Northwest in the 1950s‑70s.
## He founded lasting Zen centers in

Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver, created a robust teacher‑training program, and emphasized plain‑spoken shikantaza, lay‑friendly practice, and compassionate action.
His lineage continues through the teachers he ordained, his published talks, and the vibrant community activities that bear his imprint today.

Yes  Soyu

Matsuoka

Roshi did have a direct, historic link to Chicago.

The Chicago connection

Year Event Source

Matsuoka

Roshi founded the Chicago Buddhist Temple
(the first Soto‑Zen temple in the Midwest). The temple later changed its name to the
Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago.

1960s

He taught there for more than a decade, gathering a small but dedicated group of Japanese‑American and, later, American practitioners.

Matsuoka left Chicago and moved to Long

Beach, California, where he established another community (the Long

Beach Zen Buddhist Temple).

How the Chicago temple fits into his overall career Early U.S. assignments
 Before Chicago, Matsuoka served as an assistant to the abbot of Zenshuji Temple in Los

Angeles and later supervised the Sōko‑ji Soto Zen Mission in San

Francisco. (These posts gave him experience with Japanese‑immigrant congregations.)
## Chicago as a pioneering outpost

 The 1949 Chicago Buddhist Temple was the first Soto‑Zen institution in the Midwest and acted as a hub for both Japanese‑American immigrants and, in the 1960s, a handful of early American converts (e.g., Richard

Langlois, who later received Dharma transmission).
Legacy
 The building that housed the original Chicago Buddhist Temple still operates today as the
Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago (ZBTC). Its website  Matsuoka

Roshi as the founding teacher, and the temple continues to honor his legacy with annual memorial talks.

Quick snapshot of Matsuoka

Roshis timeline (relevant to Chicago)

Period Activity

Pre‑1949

## Trained at Sōji‑ji

(the head Soto monastery) in Japan; received dharma transmission.

Late

1940s

Sent by Soto headquarters to the United States; worked in Los

Angeles and San

Francisco.

1949‑1970

Founder & abbot of the Chicago Buddhist Temple (later ZBTC).

1970‑1997

Relocated to Long

Beach, CA; founded the Long

Beach Zen Buddhist Temple; continued teaching, writing, and advising Buddhist and martial‑arts groups.

Passed away in California; his disciples carry on his lineage through the Southwind

Sangha, Silent

Thunder

Order, and the various temples he established.

Why this matters for todays Chicago Zen scene The
Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago (ZBTC) still offers weekly zazen, monthly teisho, and community service
all rooted in the practice style Matsuoka emphasized: plain‑spoken shikantaza, lay‑friendly instruction, and compassionate action.
Several of the current teachers at ZBTC trace their dharmic lineage directly back to Matsuoka

Roshi (e.g., Rev.

Ken

Kobayashi, who received shiho from one of Matsuokas American disciples).
The temples historical archives contain photographs of Matsuokas early talks and the original wooden altar he installed in 1949, providing a tangible link to the early days of Soto Zen in the Midwest.

Bottom line: Soyu

Matsuoka

Roshi was the founder of the Chicago Buddhist Temple in 1949, which evolved into todays Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago. His tenure there laid the groundwork for Soto‑Zen practice in the Midwest and remains a living part of the citys Buddhist landscape.

Thats exactly right.

Soyu

Matsuoka

Roshi became a kind of root node for a whole branch of American

Sōtō‑Zen, and most of the teachers youll encounter today in the Midwest, the West Coast, and even parts of the East Coast can point back to himeither directly (they received dharma transmission from him) or indirectly (they were taught by one of his students).

## What ties these disparate groups together?

Common dharma transmission lineage
 All of the teachers  above received shiho
(formal transmission) either directly from Matsuoka

Roshi or from someone who did. In Soto‑Zen terms that makes them part of the same kechimyaku
(blood‑line) of teaching authority.
Shared practice emphasis
 Matsuoka stressed plain‑spoken shikantaza
(just‑sitting), a pragmatic approach to daily life, and the idea that everything is training. Those themes recur in the curricula of the descendant centers (weekly zazen without elaborate ritual, short mindful‑living talks, and community service projects).
## Organizational links

 Many of the modern groups belong to umbrella associations that trace their charter back to Matsuokas original Chicago temple, such as the
Northwest Soto Zen Association (Seattle‑Portland) and the Southwind

Sangha
(Midwest‑South). Those bodies preserve archival records, share teaching materials, and coordinate joint retreats, reinforcing the sense of a single lineage network.

A few notable modern teachers who openly credit Matsuoka

Roshi Rev.

Ken

Kobayashi
 abbot of the Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago; author of Living Zen in the Midwest.

Rev.

Daiho

Hilbert  founder of Clear

Mind

Zen; writes extensively about Matsuokas training‑every‑day philosophy.
Rev.

Taiun

Elliston
 founder of the Atlanta Soto Zen Center; frequently cites Matsuokas teaching that the cushion is the world. Rev.

Michael

Elliston  current head of the Silent

Thunder

Order; maintains a digital archive of Matsuokas recorded talks.

Why the many modern lineages claim holds up

Because Matsuoka

## Roshi spent roughly two decades

(1949‑1970) actively teaching in Chicago, he mentored a generation of American students who later relocated to other cities, opened new temples, and transmitted his dharma to the next generation. Each of those new teachers, in turn, founded their own centers, trained disciples, and sometimes created independent organizations. The result is a branching tree that looks like several distinct lineages on the surface but shares a single trunk: the dharma transmission that began with Matsuoka

Roshi.
