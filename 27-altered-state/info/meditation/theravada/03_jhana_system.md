# The Jhana System: The Most Detailed Map of Concentration States in Any Tradition

## Introduction

The jhanas (Pali: *jhana*; Sanskrit: *dhyana*) are a series of progressively refined states of meditative absorption that constitute the most detailed and systematically described map of concentration states in any contemplative tradition. The term *jhana* derives from a root meaning "to contemplate" or "to burn up" (the defilements), and the states themselves represent a systematic deepening of concentration through the progressive abandonment of coarser mental factors and the cultivation of increasingly refined states of awareness.

The jhanas are not unique to Buddhism. The Buddha reportedly learned the formless jhanas from his pre-enlightenment teachers Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. However, the systematic classification of the jhanas into eight (or nine) distinct states, with precisely defined jhana factors at each level, and the integration of these states into a comprehensive path of awakening, is distinctively Buddhist and specifically Theravadin in its fullest development.

For the consciousness research project, the jhanas provide an extraordinarily precise map of how consciousness transforms under sustained concentrated attention. Each jhana represents a stable, reproducible altered state with specific phenomenological characteristics, making the jhana system a natural subject for contemplative neuroscience research and a direct contribution to Forms 27 (Altered State) and 36 (Contemplative States) of the 40-form architecture.

## Part I: The Four Form Jhanas (Rupa Jhana)

The four form jhanas (or, in the Abhidhamma's fivefold classification, five form jhanas) are attained through sustained concentration on a meditation object (*kammatthana*). The classical objects include the ten kasinas (colored disks), the ten types of corpse (for contemplation of impermanence), the ten recollections (of the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, etc.), the four divine abidings (loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity), mindfulness of breathing (*anapanasati*), and others. Of these, mindfulness of breathing is the most widely practiced.

### The Jhana Factors

Each jhana is defined by a specific set of mental factors (*jhana-anga*) that are present in that state. The progressive refinement of the jhanas is described in terms of the sequential abandonment of coarser factors:

**The five jhana factors are:**

1. **Applied thought** (*vitakka*): The initial application of mind to the meditation object. The mental act of "placing" or "directing" attention onto the object. Analogous to a bird taking flight -- the initial effort of lifting off the ground.

2. **Sustained thought** (*vicara*): The sustained engagement of mind with the object. The mental act of "rubbing" or "polishing" attention on the object after initial application. Analogous to the bird gliding after taking flight.

3. **Rapture** (*piti*): A pervasive quality of pleasurable interest, excitement, or bliss associated with the concentrated state. The Visuddhimagga identifies five grades of rapture: minor rapture (causing goosebumps), momentary rapture (like lightning), showering rapture (washing over the body in waves), uplifting rapture (causing the body to feel light or actually levitate -- the texts take this literally), and pervading rapture (suffusing the entire body like a flood filling a cave).

4. **Happiness** (*sukha*): A deeper, more refined pleasure than rapture. Where rapture is associated with excitement and movement, happiness is associated with contentment and stillness. The classical analogy: rapture is like a thirsty person seeing water from a distance; happiness is like actually drinking it.

5. **One-pointedness** (*ekaggata*): The unification of mind on a single object. This factor is present in all jhanas and represents the core quality of concentration.

### First Jhana

**Factors present:** Applied thought, sustained thought, rapture, happiness, one-pointedness.

**What is abandoned:** The five hindrances (*nivarana*) -- sensual desire (*kamacchanda*), ill-will (*byapada*), sloth-and-torpor (*thina-middha*), restlessness-and-worry (*uddhacca-kukkucca*), and doubt (*vicikiccha*). The first jhana is the first complete suppression of the hindrances.

**Phenomenological description:** The meditator has been sustaining attention on the breath (or other object) with increasing stability. At some point, a luminous mental image (*nimitta*) may arise -- a counterpart sign (*patibhaga-nimitta*) that indicates the approach to absorption. Attention shifts to this nimitta, and as concentration locks onto it, the jhana factors manifest. The mind is suffused with rapture and happiness. The body may feel light, spacious, or vibrating with pleasurable energy. Thoughts about the meditation object may still arise (vitakka and vicara are present), but they are refined and non-discursive -- more like a gentle mental touching of the object than ordinary conceptual thinking.

**The first jhana's distinctive quality:** It is the first experience of genuine mental seclusion (*viveka*) from the sensory realm. The meditator is temporarily free from the grip of the five hindrances, and this freedom is experienced as a profound relief and joy.

**Sutta description:** "Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion." (MN 119)

### Second Jhana

**Factors present:** Rapture, happiness, one-pointedness. (In the Abhidhamma's fivefold system, internal confidence (*sampasadana*) replaces applied and sustained thought.)

**What is abandoned:** Applied thought (*vitakka*) and sustained thought (*vicara*). The mind no longer needs to "place" or "sustain" attention on the object -- concentration has become self-sustaining.

**Phenomenological description:** The subtle mental activity of the first jhana (the "touching" quality of vitakka and vicara) subsides, and the mind rests in a state of uninterrupted, effortless concentration. Rapture and happiness intensify because they are no longer disrupted by even the subtlest discursive mental activity. A quality of inner confidence or clarity (*sampasadana*) arises -- the mind knows, from its own stillness, that concentration is secure.

**The second jhana's distinctive quality:** Internal confidence and the cessation of all discursive mental activity. The meditator's attention is like a spring-fed lake with no inlet -- the water (concentration) arises from within, not from external effort.

**Sutta description:** "With the subsiding of applied thought and sustained thought, a bhikkhu enters and abides in the second jhana, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without applied thought and sustained thought, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration." (MN 119)

### Third Jhana

**Factors present:** Happiness, one-pointedness.

**What is abandoned:** Rapture (*piti*). The excited, energizing quality of rapture is recognized as a subtle form of agitation and is let go.

**Phenomenological description:** The dissolution of rapture produces a state of profound calm and contentment. The happiness that remains is not an excited joy but a deep, stable, bodily and mental well-being. The Visuddhimagga compares it to a lotus standing in still water, completely suffused with coolness. The mind is extraordinarily still, and the meditator abides in what the Buddha calls "the pleasant abiding" (*sukha-vihara*).

**The third jhana's distinctive quality:** Equanimity (*upekkha*) begins to emerge alongside happiness. The meditator observes the happiness without being carried away by it. The texts describe this as "abiding in equanimity" while "experiencing happiness with the body."

**Sutta description:** "With the fading away of rapture, a bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and clearly comprehending, still feeling happiness with the body, he enters and abides in the third jhana, on account of which the noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.'" (MN 119)

### Fourth Jhana

**Factors present:** Equanimity (*upekkha*), one-pointedness (*ekaggata*).

**What is abandoned:** Happiness (*sukha*). Even the refined pleasure of the third jhana is let go. Feeling shifts from pleasant to neutral.

**Phenomenological description:** The fourth jhana is a state of pure equanimous awareness. There is no pleasure, no pain -- only perfectly balanced, crystalline awareness. The mind is compared to a person sitting wrapped in a white cloth from head to foot, with no part of the body untouched -- equanimity pervades the entire field of experience. Breathing may become extremely subtle or appear to cease entirely. The mind is supremely still, bright, and clear.

**The fourth jhana's distinctive quality:** This is the state of "purification of mindfulness by equanimity" (*upekkha-sati-parisuddhi*). Mindfulness is at its peak -- not because of effort but because all disturbing factors have been removed. The mind is like a perfectly polished mirror, reflecting whatever is presented without distortion.

**Sutta description:** "With the abandoning of happiness and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters and abides in the fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity." (MN 119)

The fourth jhana is the platform for all higher attainments. The psychic powers (*abhinna*) described in the suttas -- telepathy, clairvoyance, recollection of past lives -- are said to be developed from the base of the fourth jhana. More importantly for the insight path, the fourth jhana provides the optimal state of consciousness for vipassana practice: awareness is maximally clear, stable, and equanimous, allowing the three characteristics (impermanence, suffering, non-self) to be perceived with penetrating precision.

## Part II: The Four Formless Jhanas (Arupa Jhana)

The four formless jhanas transcend the realm of form altogether. They are attained by taking as the meditation object not a visual image or physical sensation but an increasingly refined mental concept. Each formless jhana represents a further abstraction from the ordinary categories of experience.

### Fifth Jhana / First Formless: Base of Infinite Space (Akasanancayatana)

**How attained:** The meditator, established in the fourth jhana with a kasina (colored disk) as the object, mentally expands the kasina until it pervades the entire field of awareness, then removes the kasina and attends to the infinite space that remains.

**Phenomenological description:** Consciousness rests in boundless, limitless space. There is no sense of boundary, no edge, no center. The perception of form has completely ceased. The experience is not of "seeing" space but of consciousness being coextensive with infinite space.

### Sixth Jhana / Second Formless: Base of Infinite Consciousness (Vinnanancayatana)

**How attained:** The meditator shifts attention from the infinite space to the consciousness that pervades it. The focus moves from the "container" (space) to the "contained" (the awareness of space).

**Phenomenological description:** Consciousness becomes aware of itself as infinite. There is no object other than consciousness itself -- consciousness knowing consciousness, extending without limit. This is sometimes described as the most "self-referential" of the jhanas, as consciousness turns back upon itself.

### Seventh Jhana / Third Formless: Base of Nothingness (Akincannayatana)

**How attained:** The meditator attends to the absence of the infinite consciousness that was the object of the previous jhana. The focus shifts to "there is nothing" -- the non-existence of the previous object.

**Phenomenological description:** A profound emptiness or voidness. Consciousness rests in the apprehension of absence, nothingness, non-occurrence. This is not an experience of depression or negation but a refined awareness of the absence of any object. The mind is extremely still and subtle.

### Eighth Jhana / Fourth Formless: Base of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception (Nevasannanasannayatana)

**How attained:** The meditator, recognizing that even the perception of nothingness is a perception and therefore a form of agitation, refines awareness to the point where perception is so attenuated that it can neither be called perception nor non-perception.

**Phenomenological description:** The most refined state of consciousness possible while still technically conscious. Mental activity is so subtle that it almost ceases. The meditator cannot clearly report what is being experienced because the cognitive faculties needed for reporting are themselves barely functioning. This state is described as the peak of mundane mental development -- the most refined possible modification of ordinary consciousness.

The Buddha's pre-enlightenment teacher Uddaka Ramaputta taught this state as the highest attainment. The Buddha, however, recognized it as still conditioned, still impermanent, and therefore not the final liberation. His critical innovation was to develop vipassana (insight) meditation using the jhanic states as a platform for investigation rather than as ends in themselves.

---

## Part III: Cessation of Perception and Feeling (Nirodha-samapatti)

### The Ninth Attainment

Beyond the eight jhanas lies a state called **cessation of perception and feeling** (*sanna-vedayita-nirodha*), also known as *nirodha-samapatti* (attainment of cessation). This is accessible only to non-returners (*anagami*) and arahants who have also mastered all eight jhanas.

**How attained:** The meditator passes through all eight jhanas in sequence, then, from the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, resolves to enter cessation. The meditator must first make determinations regarding the duration of the attainment and must ensure that the body will be safe during the period of cessation.

**Phenomenological description:** All mental activity ceases. There is no consciousness, no perception, no feeling, no volition. The body continues its minimal metabolic functions, but the mental continuum is completely suspended. The Abhidhamma describes this state as the temporary suspension of the citta-vithi -- the complete cessation of the stream of consciousness.

**Duration:** The attainment can last up to seven days according to the traditional texts. Emergence from cessation occurs through a predetermined resolution or through the natural expiry of the intended duration.

**Significance for consciousness research:** Nirodha-samapatti is the most radical state described in any contemplative tradition -- the complete absence of subjective experience while the body remains alive. If this state is genuine (and reports from traditions beyond Theravada -- including some Tibetan Buddhist practices -- describe similar states), it raises profound questions for consciousness research:

- Is it possible for consciousness to completely cease while bodily functions continue?
- Does this state represent a "control condition" for consciousness -- showing what the organism is like when subjective experience is absent?
- What is the relationship between consciousness and life? Can the body maintain itself without any form of awareness?
- What is the experience of "returning" from a state of no experience? How does consciousness restart after complete cessation?

## Part IV: The Jhana Factor Analysis

### Progressive Refinement

The progression through the jhanas can be understood as the systematic subtraction of mental factors:

| Jhana | Factors Present | Factor Abandoned |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| First | Vitakka, Vicara, Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata | Five Hindrances |
| Second | Piti, Sukha, Ekaggata | Vitakka, Vicara |
| Third | Sukha, Ekaggata | Piti |
| Fourth | Upekkha, Ekaggata | Sukha |
| Infinite Space | Ekaggata (with formless object) | Perception of form |
| Infinite Consciousness | Ekaggata | Perception of space |
| Nothingness | Ekaggata | Perception of consciousness |
| Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception | Ekaggata (barely) | Perception of nothingness |
| Cessation | None | All perception and feeling |

This progressive subtraction is significant for consciousness research. It shows that what we experience as "consciousness" is a composite of multiple factors, and that these factors can be selectively removed while maintaining an overall state of awareness (until the final cessation). This is analogous to the scientific method of varying one factor while holding others constant, and it suggests that the jhana system provides a natural "experimental paradigm" for investigating the contribution of different mental factors to the overall quality of conscious experience.

### The Five Mastery Skills

For each jhana, the Visuddhimagga describes five mastery skills (*vasibhava*) that must be developed:

1. **Adverting mastery** (*avajjana-vasi*): The ability to turn the mind toward a jhana immediately after emerging from it
2. **Attaining mastery** (*samapajjana-vasi*): The ability to enter the jhana at will, without delay
3. **Resolving mastery** (*adhitthana-vasi*): The ability to remain in the jhana for a predetermined duration
4. **Emerging mastery** (*vutthana-vasi*): The ability to emerge from the jhana at a predetermined time
5. **Reviewing mastery** (*paccavekkhana-vasi*): The ability to review the jhana and its factors after emerging

These mastery skills transform the jhanas from incidental experiences into stable, reproducible, controllable states -- precisely the kind of states that are amenable to scientific investigation.

## Part V: The Jhana Debate -- Hard vs. Soft

### The Central Controversy

Contemporary Theravada is divided by a significant debate about the nature of jhana attainment, particularly regarding how "deep" the absorption must be to qualify as genuine jhana.

### The "Hard Jhana" Position

**Key advocates:** Ajahn Brahm, Pa Auk Sayadaw, the Visuddhimagga commentary tradition.

**Core claims:**
- Jhana is a state of full absorption (*appana-samadhi*) in which the five senses are completely shut down. The meditator does not hear sounds, feel bodily sensations, or perceive any object other than the mental counterpart sign (*patibhaga-nimitta*).
- The jhana factors described in the suttas are not present in ordinary concentrated awareness; they are features of a qualitatively different mode of consciousness.
- The distinction between access concentration (*upacara-samadhi*) and full absorption (*appana-samadhi*) is sharp, not gradual. One is either "in" jhana or not.
- The luminous nimitta (mental image) is a necessary feature of the approach to jhana.

**Ajahn Brahm's description:** In genuine jhana, the meditator has completely "abandoned the world." There is no awareness of the body, no hearing, no thinking. There is only the jhana object and the jhana factors -- rapture, happiness, and one-pointedness pervading the entire field of awareness. The experience is unmistakable: one does not wonder whether one was "in jhana" -- if there is any doubt, it was not jhana.

### The "Soft Jhana" Position

**Key advocates:** Leigh Brasington, Bhante Vimalaramsi, Thanissaro Bhikkhu, some academic scholars (Arbel, Polak).

**Core claims:**
- The sutta descriptions of jhana do not require complete sensory shutdown. The meditator in jhana is described as hearing sounds and even engaging in conversation in certain contexts.
- The Visuddhimagga's description of jhana as full absorption is a later commentarial interpretation that does not reflect the original sutta understanding.
- Jhana is better understood as a deep but not total immersion in concentrated awareness, in which the jhana factors are present but the meditator retains some background awareness of the body and environment.
- The distinction between access concentration and absorption is a spectrum, not a binary.

**Leigh Brasington's approach:** Brasington teaches jhanas as states that are entered through sustained pleasure concentration. The meditator develops access concentration, then shifts attention to a pleasant sensation (often a pleasurable bodily feeling or the mental pleasure of concentration itself) and allows the jhana factors to develop. The resulting states are deep and clearly altered, but they do not involve complete sensory shutdown.

**Thanissaro Bhikkhu's position:** The sutta jhanas are states of whole-body awareness -- the meditator is aware of the breath energy pervading the entire body, and the jhana factors (rapture, happiness) are experienced as whole-body phenomena, not as abstract mental states divorced from somatic experience. This interpretation preserves the body-awareness that the Visuddhimagga's hard jhana model eliminates.

### Resolution and Significance

The jhana debate remains unresolved. From the perspective of consciousness research, both "hard" and "soft" jhanas are interesting altered states worthy of investigation. The key question is whether they represent points on a continuum of concentration or qualitatively different modes of consciousness. Neuroimaging studies of jhana practitioners (discussed below) may eventually provide empirical evidence that bears on this question.

---

## Part VI: Neuroscience of Jhana

### Empirical Research

The neuroscientific study of jhana is still in its early stages, but several important findings have emerged:

**Hagerty et al. (2013):** An fMRI study of a single practitioner (trained in the Leigh Brasington method) moving through the four form jhanas. The study found progressive decreases in activation of the default mode network (DMN) as the practitioner moved through successive jhanas, consistent with the phenomenological reports of decreasing self-referential processing. Dopamine reward circuits showed increasing activation, particularly in the first and second jhanas, correlating with the rapture and happiness factors.

**Dennison (2019):** EEG studies of jhana practitioners showed distinctive patterns of high-amplitude alpha and theta waves, particularly in frontal and parietal regions, during reported jhana states. The patterns were qualitatively different from ordinary relaxation, focused attention meditation, and sleep.

**Delgado-Pastor et al. (2013) and related work:** Studies of expert meditators in near-cessation states have found dramatic reductions in respiratory rate, heart rate, and metabolic activity, consistent with the Theravada descriptions of the body becoming extremely still and the breath becoming subtle or apparently ceasing in the fourth jhana and beyond.

### What the Research Suggests

The available neuroscience evidence, while preliminary, is consistent with several aspects of the traditional jhana description:

1. **Progressive deactivation of self-referential processing:** The decreasing DMN activation across jhanas parallels the phenomenological report of the self-sense progressively fading as concentration deepens.

2. **Activation of reward circuits:** The dopamine activation in early jhanas is consistent with the intense pleasure (piti, sukha) reported in these states.

3. **Distinctive neural signatures:** Jhana states produce brain patterns that are distinguishable from other meditative and non-meditative states, suggesting they represent genuine altered states of consciousness rather than placebo or expectation effects.

4. **Metabolic changes:** The dramatic physiological changes in advanced concentration states confirm that these practices produce measurable effects on autonomic nervous system function.

### Research Gaps

Much remains to be investigated:
- No study has yet compared "hard jhana" and "soft jhana" practitioners under identical neuroimaging conditions.
- The formless jhanas and cessation have not been studied with modern neuroimaging.
- Large-sample studies are lacking; most existing research involves single practitioners or very small groups.
- The relationship between jhana-related brain changes and the personality/trait changes reported by long-term practitioners has not been systematically studied.

## Part VII: Connection to the Consciousness Project

### Jhanas and the 40-Form Architecture

The jhana system bears directly on several forms in the consciousness project's architecture:

**Form 27 (Altered State Consciousness):** The jhanas are among the most well-defined and systematically described altered states of consciousness in any tradition. Each jhana has specific entry conditions, defining characteristics, and exit procedures. The progressive subtraction of mental factors across the jhana sequence provides a natural framework for studying how the qualitative character of consciousness changes as different cognitive functions are selectively attenuated.

**Form 36 (Contemplative States):** The jhanas represent the paradigmatic contemplative states. Their precise phenomenological descriptions and the tradition's emphasis on reproducibility and mastery make them ideal candidates for scientific investigation of contemplative experience.

**Form 18 (Primary Consciousness):** The fourth jhana, with its pure equanimous awareness stripped of pleasure, pain, and discursive thought, may provide the closest phenomenological approximation to "primary consciousness" -- awareness in its most basic form, before the addition of affective coloring and conceptual elaboration.

**Form 13 (Integrated Information):** The progressive unification of consciousness across the jhana sequence -- from the relatively fragmented awareness of ordinary experience to the perfectly unified one-pointedness of deep absorption -- provides a phenomenological counterpart to theories of consciousness based on information integration (IIT). The question of whether increasing unification of consciousness corresponds to increasing or decreasing phi (integrated information) is an intriguing empirical question.

**Cessation and the "zero point" of consciousness:** Nirodha-samapatti -- the complete cessation of consciousness -- provides, if genuine, a natural "control condition" for consciousness research. Understanding what happens to the brain when subjective experience completely ceases, and what happens when it resumes, could provide crucial evidence about the neural correlates of consciousness.
