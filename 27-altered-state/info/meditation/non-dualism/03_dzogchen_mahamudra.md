# Dzogchen and Mahamudra: The Non-Dual Pinnacles of Tibetan Buddhism

Two contemplative traditions stand at the summit of Tibetan Buddhist practice: **Dzogchen** (rdzogs chen, "Great Perfection") and **Mahamudra** (phyag rgya chen po, "Great Seal"). Both traditions claim to reveal the nature of mind directly, without the elaborate conceptual scaffolding of scholastic Buddhism. Both assert that awareness itself -- naked, luminous, and empty -- is the ground, path, and fruition of the spiritual life. Yet they arrive at this shared conclusion through distinct historical lineages, philosophical vocabularies, and contemplative methods.

Understanding these two traditions is essential for any serious investigation of consciousness, because they represent perhaps the most refined phenomenological accounts of awareness available in any civilization's contemplative heritage. Where Western philosophy of mind has largely theorized about consciousness from the outside, Dzogchen and Mahamudra offer systematic first-person methodologies for investigating awareness from within.

# PART I: DZOGCHEN -- The Great Perfection

## 1. Overview

Dzogchen, variously translated as "Great Perfection," "Great Completion," or "Total Completeness," is considered the highest and most direct teaching in the **Nyingma** (rnying ma) school of Tibetan Buddhism. It is also preserved in the **Bon** tradition, Tibet's indigenous spiritual system, which claims its own independent Dzogchen lineage tracing back to the teacher Tonpa Shenrab.

The central claim of Dzogchen is radical in its simplicity: the nature of mind is already perfectly awakened. There is nothing to purify, nothing to cultivate, nothing to achieve. The practitioner's sole task is to recognize what has always been the case -- that awareness itself, in its naked immediacy, is the ground of buddhahood. This recognition is called **rigpa** (rig pa), a Tibetan term meaning "knowing" or "awareness" in its most fundamental, non-conceptual sense.

Dzogchen distinguishes itself from other Buddhist paths by claiming that it does not work through gradual purification or transformation. Instead, it operates through **self-recognition** -- awareness recognizing its own nature. In this respect, Dzogchen considers itself a "resultant" vehicle: the practitioner begins from the perspective of the result (awakened awareness) rather than working toward it through causal practices.

## 2. Historical Origins

The traditional account places Dzogchen's origin with **Garab Dorje** (dga' rab rdo rje), said to have been born in the Uddiyana region (likely in modern-day Pakistan's Swat Valley) around the 1st century CE. According to hagiographic sources, Garab Dorje received the Dzogchen teachings directly from the dharmakaya buddha Vajrasattva in a visionary transmission, making him the first human Dzogchen master.

Garab Dorje transmitted the teachings to **Manjushrimitra** ('jam dpal bshes gnyen), who systematized them into the three series: Mind (sems sde), Space (klong sde), and Secret Instruction (man ngag sde). Manjushrimitra passed them to **Shri Singha**, who continued the lineage in India and Central Asia.

The decisive moment for Dzogchen in Tibet came in the **8th century** when the Tibetan emperor Trisong Detsen invited **Padmasambhava** (Guru Rinpoche) and **Vimalamitra** to Tibet. Padmasambhava is credited with subduing local spiritual forces, establishing Buddhism in Tibet, and transmitting the Dzogchen teachings that would become the core of the Nyingma tradition. Many of these teachings were concealed as **terma** (gter ma) -- hidden treasure texts -- to be discovered by future masters (tertons) when the time was ripe.

The historical-critical perspective is more cautious. Scholars such as Samten Karmay and David Germano have traced Dzogchen's literary development, noting that many of the earliest texts likely date from the 9th-11th centuries rather than the 1st century. The tradition's Indian origins remain debated, with some scholars pointing to connections with Shaiva non-dual traditions, Chan Buddhism, or indigenous Bon practices.

## 3. Key Figures

**Garab Dorje** (c. 55 CE, traditional dating) -- The first human Dzogchen master. His final testament, the **Three Statements That Strike the Essential Point** (Tshig gsum gnad du brdeg pa), encapsulates the entire Dzogchen path: (1) Direct introduction to one's own nature; (2) Not remaining in doubt about this; (3) Continuing in confidence with liberation. These three statements function as the structural backbone of all subsequent Dzogchen instruction.

**Padmasambhava** (8th century) -- Known as Guru Rinpoche ("Precious Teacher"), he is the central figure in bringing Dzogchen to Tibet. He concealed innumerable terma teachings throughout Tibet's landscape and is venerated as a "second Buddha" in the Nyingma tradition.

**Vimalamitra** (8th century) -- A master from India who brought the **Vima Nyingthig** (bi ma snying thig) cycle of teachings to Tibet. His transmission represents one of the two main streams of Dzogchen pith-instruction (the other being the Khandro Nyingthig associated with Padmasambhava).

**Longchenpa** (klong chen rab 'byams pa, 1308-1364) -- Perhaps the greatest Dzogchen philosopher and systematizer. His **Seven Treasuries** (mdzod bdun) provide the most comprehensive philosophical treatment of Dzogchen in existence. He also composed the **Trilogy of Natural Ease** (ngal gso skor gsum) and unified the Vima Nyingthig and Khandro Nyingthig into a grand synthesis. Longchenpa's work bridges rigorous Madhyamaka philosophy with direct contemplative instruction, making him the towering intellectual figure of the tradition.

**Jigme Lingpa** ('jigs med gling pa, 1730-1798) -- Discoverer of the **Longchen Nyingthig** (klong chen snying thig) terma cycle, which he received through visionary encounters with Longchenpa. This cycle became the most widely practiced Dzogchen system in Tibet and remains so today. His Treasury of Precious Qualities (yon tan mdzod) is a major scholastic treatise.

**Patrul Rinpoche** (dpal sprul rin po che, 1808-1887) -- Author of **The Words of My Perfect Teacher** (kun bzang bla ma'i zhal lung), the most beloved and accessible introduction to the Nyingma path. A wandering ascetic who eschewed institutional authority, Patrul Rinpoche also composed direct Dzogchen instructions including the famous **Special Teaching of the Wise and Glorious King** (mkhas pa shri rgyal po'i khyad chos).

**Dudjom Rinpoche** (bdud 'joms rin po che, 1904-1987) -- Recognized as the supreme head of the Nyingma tradition after the Tibetan diaspora. His writings include a comprehensive history of the Nyingma school and direct Dzogchen instructions of exceptional clarity. He was instrumental in preserving Dzogchen in exile.

**Namkhai Norbu** (1938-2018) -- A Tibetan scholar and master who founded the **Dzogchen Community** and was among the first to teach Dzogchen openly to Western students. His approach emphasized Dzogchen as a teaching that transcends religious and cultural boundaries, accessible to practitioners of any background.

**Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche** (b. 1961) -- A Bon lineage holder who has been instrumental in transmitting **Bon Dzogchen** to Western audiences. His work emphasizes the Bon tradition's claim to an independent Dzogchen lineage predating Buddhism in Tibet, and he has written extensively on the Bon approach to dream yoga and sleep practice.

## 4. Core Philosophical Claims

### Rigpa: Pure Awareness as the Ground

The foundational claim of Dzogchen is that **rigpa** -- intrinsic awareness -- is the ground (gzhi) of all experience. Rigpa is not something produced by meditation, nor is it a state to be attained. It is the ever-present nature of mind that is merely obscured by the adventitious movement of conceptual thought. The analogy frequently used is the sky obscured by clouds: the sky (rigpa) is always present and unaffected by the clouds (thoughts, emotions, habitual patterns) that temporarily veil it.

### The Three Aspects of Rigpa

Dzogchen describes the nature of rigpa through three inseparable aspects:

- **Essence (ngo bo)** is **empty** (stong pa) -- awareness has no fixed, findable substance. When you look for the mind, nothing is found.
- **Nature (rang bzhin)** is **luminous** (gsal ba) -- despite being empty, awareness is not a blank void. It is vivid, cognizant, and ceaselessly knowing.
- **Energy (thugs rje)** is **unceasing** (ma 'gags pa) -- the dynamic display of awareness manifests without interruption as thoughts, perceptions, and the entire phenomenal world. Thugs rje literally means "compassion," indicating that the spontaneous expression of awareness is inherently compassionate.

These three aspects are not separate components but a single reality described from three perspectives. They are sometimes compared to the sun: its essence is empty space, its nature is luminous radiance, and its energy is the warmth that reaches everywhere.

### Kadag and Lhun Grub

Two terms define the ground in Dzogchen:

- **Kadag** (ka dag) -- **primordial purity**. The ground has never been stained by delusion. Even in the midst of confusion, rigpa remains pure. This is the "alpha purity" that precedes all experience.
- **Lhun grub** (lhun grub) -- **spontaneous presence**. The qualities of awakening are not created but are spontaneously present within rigpa. Buddhahood is not manufactured; it is unveiled.

### Trekcho and Togal

The two principal Dzogchen practices correspond to these two aspects of the ground:

- **Trekcho** (khregs chod) -- "Cutting Through" or "Breakthrough." This practice corresponds to kadag. The practitioner learns to recognize rigpa and rest in it, allowing thoughts and experiences to self-liberate without intervention. Trekcho is the essential Dzogchen practice: simply resting in the recognition of awareness.
- **Togal** (thod rgal) -- "Direct Crossing" or "Leap Over." This practice corresponds to lhun grub. It involves specific body postures and gazing techniques that activate the manifestation of spontaneous visions (luminous spheres, rainbow light, deity forms). Togal is considered extremely advanced and is traditionally practiced only after stable realization of trekcho.

### Self-Liberation

Perhaps the most distinctive Dzogchen principle is **self-liberation** (rang grol). In Dzogchen, thoughts and emotions are not suppressed, transformed, or cultivated. They are allowed to liberate upon arising, like a drawing on water that dissolves the moment it is made. The practitioner does not do anything to the thought; recognition itself is the liberating factor. This is described through three levels of increasing subtlety: liberation upon arising (shar grol), self-liberation (rang grol), and naked liberation (cer grol).

## 5. Practices

**Preliminary Practices (Ngondro):** Before receiving Dzogchen instruction, practitioners typically complete the ngondro: 100,000 prostrations, 100,000 Vajrasattva mantras, 100,000 mandala offerings, and 100,000 guru yoga recitations. These are considered essential for purifying obscurations and establishing the proper relationship with the teacher.

**Trekcho (Cutting Through):** The main practice. After receiving **direct introduction** (ngo sprod) from a qualified master -- in which the teacher points out the nature of mind -- the practitioner rests in the recognition of rigpa. Sessions alternate between formal sitting and post-meditation awareness in daily activities.

**Togal (Direct Crossing):** Advanced practices involving specific gazing at sunlight (carefully), the open sky, or darkness, combined with particular body postures. These practices catalyze the manifestation of thigles (luminous spheres) and other vision experiences that represent the spontaneous display of rigpa.

**Dark Retreat (mun mtshams):** Extended retreat in total darkness, typically 49 days, used to accelerate togal practice. In the absence of external light, the practitioner's internal luminosity becomes visible.

**Sky Gazing:** An open-awareness practice where the practitioner gazes into the vast expanse of a clear sky, using the boundlessness of the sky as a support for recognizing the boundless nature of awareness itself.

# PART II: MAHAMUDRA -- The Great Seal

## 1. Overview

Mahamudra, the "Great Seal" or "Great Symbol," is the central meditative tradition of the **Kagyu** (bka' brgyud) school of Tibetan Buddhism, though it is also taught in the Gelug and Sakya schools in modified forms. The name "Great Seal" (phyag rgya chen po) conveys the idea that all phenomena are "sealed" with the nature of ultimate reality -- that emptiness and luminosity pervade every experience without exception.

Where Dzogchen emphasizes the primordial purity of awareness, Mahamudra begins from a complementary vantage point: **ordinary mind** (tha mal gyi shes pa) is itself the nature of mind. There is no special state to achieve, no exotic awareness to cultivate. The mundane, everyday mind -- when seen clearly, without the overlay of conceptual elaboration -- is itself the buddha nature. This approach gives Mahamudra a characteristic directness and simplicity.

Mahamudra encompasses three approaches: **sutra Mahamudra** (based on the Prajnaparamita and general Mahayana teachings on emptiness), **tantra Mahamudra** (based on the completion-stage practices of Vajrayana), and **essence Mahamudra** (direct pointing-out instruction independent of either sutra or tantra). Essence Mahamudra, attributed to Gampopa's synthesis, is the approach most widely practiced today.

## 2. Historical Origins

Mahamudra traces its origins to the **Indian Mahasiddha** tradition -- the "great accomplished ones" who flourished in India roughly between the 8th and 12th centuries. These were unconventional practitioners, often from low-caste or non-monastic backgrounds, who pursued awakening through direct experience rather than scholastic study.

The tradition's foundational figure is **Tilopa** (988-1069), who is said to have received the Mahamudra teaching directly from the dharmakaya buddha Vajradhara, bypassing any human guru. Tilopa transmitted the teaching to his student **Naropa** (1016-1100), a former abbot of Nalanda University who underwent twelve years of harrowing trials under Tilopa's guidance before receiving the full transmission.

**Marpa Lotsawa** (1012-1097), a Tibetan farmer and translator, made multiple dangerous journeys to India to study with Naropa and other masters. He brought Mahamudra and the Six Yogas of Naropa back to Tibet, inaugurating the Kagyu lineage. His student **Milarepa** (1052-1135) became Tibet's most beloved yogi, whose life of austere mountain retreat and spontaneous songs of realization exemplify the Mahamudra ideal. Milarepa's student **Gampopa** (1079-1153) accomplished the decisive synthesis: he merged the Mahamudra transmission of the Mahasiddha lineage with the graduated sutra path of the Kadampa tradition, creating a comprehensive system accessible to monastic and lay practitioners alike.

From Gampopa, the Kagyu lineage branched into multiple sub-schools, each preserving and developing the Mahamudra teachings: the Karma Kagyu (headed by the successive Karmapas), the Drukpa Kagyu, the Drikung Kagyu, and others.

## 3. Key Figures

**Tilopa** (988-1069) -- The wellspring of the lineage. His **Six Words of Advice** (a famous distillation of Mahamudra) instructs: "Don't recall. Don't imagine. Don't think. Don't examine. Don't control. Rest." His **Ganges Mahamudra** (Mahamudra Upadesha) is a foundational text taught and commented upon to this day.

**Naropa** (1016-1100) -- Tilopa's primary disciple. Besides receiving Mahamudra, Naropa systematized the **Six Yogas** (na ro chos drug) -- inner heat (tummo), illusory body, dream yoga, clear light, bardo, and transference of consciousness -- which constitute the tantric complement to Mahamudra practice.

**Marpa the Translator** (1012-1097) -- The householder-yogi who brought Mahamudra from India to Tibet. Marpa exemplifies the tradition's teaching that awakening does not require renunciation of worldly life; he was a farmer, husband, and father.

**Milarepa** (1052-1135) -- Widely regarded as Tibet's greatest yogi. After a dark early life involving sorcery and murder, Milarepa underwent extreme purificatory trials under Marpa before spending years in solitary mountain caves. His **Hundred Thousand Songs** (mi la ras pa'i mgur 'bum) remain among the most powerful contemplative literature in any language -- spontaneous expressions of realization in poetic verse.

**Gampopa** (1079-1153) -- Called the "Physician from Dakpo," Gampopa's genius was in making Mahamudra accessible through a graduated framework. His **Jewel Ornament of Liberation** (dam chos yid bzhin nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan) presents the entire Mahayana path from the ground up, culminating in Mahamudra. He established the institutional foundation for the Kagyu monastic tradition.

**Rangjung Dorje, the 3rd Karmapa** (1284-1339) -- A towering philosopher who composed the **Treatise Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom** (rnam shes ye shes 'byed pa) and other works that articulated the philosophical basis of Mahamudra in terms of buddha nature (tathagatagarbha) theory and Yogacara thought. His **Aspiration Prayer of Mahamudra** (phyag chen smon lam) is recited throughout the Kagyu world.

**Wangchuk Dorje, the 9th Karmapa** (1556-1603) -- Author of the three classic Mahamudra meditation manuals: **The Ocean of Definitive Meaning** (nges don rgya mtsho), **Pointing Out the Dharmakaya** (chos sku mdzub tshugs), and **Dispelling the Darkness of Ignorance** (ma rig mun sel). These texts systematize the progressive stages of Mahamudra meditation and remain the standard instructional guides.

**Kalu Rinpoche** (1905-1989) -- One of the first Tibetan masters to teach Mahamudra extensively in the West. He established numerous retreat centers and guided Western students through the traditional three-year, three-month retreat (lo gsum phyogs gsum), making the full depth of Kagyu practice available outside Tibet.

## 4. Core Philosophical Claims

### Ordinary Mind as the Nature of Mind

Mahamudra's central assertion is that **ordinary mind** (tha mal gyi shes pa) -- consciousness in its natural, uncontrived state -- **is** the nature of mind (sems nyid). The word "ordinary" here does not mean mundane or confused; it means the mind as it is before we overlay it with conceptual elaboration, hope, fear, or spiritual ambition. When all such overlays are relaxed, what remains is luminous emptiness -- the very thing that Buddhist philosophy calls buddha nature.

This claim carries a profound methodological implication: the practitioner does not need to create, fabricate, or attain some special state. The path consists entirely in **recognizing what is already present** and learning to rest in that recognition without distraction or contrivance.

### Three Characteristics of the Nature of Mind

Mahamudra describes the nature of mind through three inseparable characteristics:

- **Clarity (gsal ba)** -- Mind is luminous and cognizant. It knows. This knowing quality is vivid and undeniable.
- **Emptiness (stong pa nyid)** -- Mind has no findable substance, no location, no color, no shape. When examined, it cannot be found as a thing.
- **Inseparability (zung 'jug)** -- Clarity and emptiness are not two separate qualities juxtaposed but a single reality. Mind is simultaneously empty and luminous, like a mirror that is both insubstantial and vividly reflective.

### The Four Yogas of Mahamudra

Mahamudra maps the practitioner's progressive deepening through **four yogas** (rnal 'byor bzhi), each with three sub-stages (lesser, middling, and greater):

1. **One-Pointedness (rtse gcig)** -- The mind rests stably on the nature of mind without distraction. Calm and clarity are established.
2. **Simplicity (spros bral)** -- Through analytical investigation and direct looking, the practitioner sees that the nature of mind is empty -- free from all conceptual elaboration (spros pa). This is the "cutting through" of Mahamudra.
3. **One Taste (ro gcig)** -- The practitioner realizes that all phenomena -- thoughts, emotions, sensory experiences, samsara and nirvana -- share a single "taste" of luminous emptiness. Distinctions between meditation and post-meditation, sacred and profane, collapse.
4. **Non-Meditation (sgom med)** -- The culmination. There is nothing left to meditate on, no meditator meditating, and no act of meditation. Practice and realization are inseparable from the flow of ordinary life. Habitual tendencies dissolve spontaneously.

## 5. Practices

**Shamatha (Calm Abiding):** Mahamudra begins with the stabilization of attention. The practitioner trains in settling the mind using a support (typically the breath) and eventually transitions to **objectless shamatha** -- resting in open, spacious awareness without any focal point.

**Vipashyana (Insight):** Once stability is established, the practitioner turns the mind's attention upon itself. "Look at the mind. What is it? Where is it? What color? What shape?" Through this direct investigation, the practitioner discovers that the mind is unfindable -- empty yet vividly aware. This is the Mahamudra vipashyana.

**Pointing-Out Instruction (ngo sprod):** The master directly introduces the student to the nature of mind. This may occur through a word, a gesture, a question, a sudden shout, or a moment of silence. The pointing-out instruction is considered the heart of Mahamudra transmission and traditionally requires a guru-disciple relationship of trust and devotion.

**Four-Session Yoga (thun bzhi'i rnal 'byor):** A structured daily practice framework dividing the day and night into four sessions, integrating formal meditation with mindful engagement in eating, walking, sleeping, and all activities. This structure supports the continuous recognition of the nature of mind throughout all circumstances.

# PART III: COMPARISON AND INTEGRATION

## How Dzogchen and Mahamudra Relate

The relationship between Dzogchen and Mahamudra has been the subject of extensive commentary by Tibetan masters themselves. The dominant view among ecumenical (ris med) teachers is that the two traditions converge at the level of ultimate realization while differing in their approach, vocabulary, and emphasis.

**Shared ground:** Both traditions assert that awareness is primordially pure and luminous, that awakening is not fabricated but recognized, and that the nature of mind is beyond conceptual elaboration. Both employ pointing-out instruction as the pivotal moment of the path.

**Differences in approach:** Dzogchen begins from the perspective of the **ground** -- primordial purity (kadag). It emphasizes that rigpa has never been stained and that recognition is instantaneous and complete. The orientation is, in a sense, from the top down. Mahamudra, by contrast, tends to work from the **path** upward, beginning with shamatha and vipashyana and progressively deepening through the four yogas. Even essence Mahamudra, which bypasses the gradual stages, retains the language of "ordinary mind" rather than Dzogchen's more transcendent vocabulary of "rigpa."

**Vocabulary:** Where Dzogchen speaks of rigpa (intrinsic awareness), Mahamudra speaks of sems nyid (the nature of mind) or tha mal gyi shes pa (ordinary mind). Where Dzogchen distinguishes kadag and lhun grub, Mahamudra speaks of stong pa nyid (emptiness) and gsal ba (clarity). These terminological differences reflect genuine differences in emphasis but not, most masters insist, in ultimate meaning.

**Historical cross-pollination:** Many masters have practiced and taught both traditions. The great Kagyu master **Karma Chagme** (17th century) composed texts explicitly integrating Dzogchen and Mahamudra. The ris med (non-sectarian) movement of the 19th century, championed by figures like **Jamgon Kongtrul** and **Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo**, emphasized the complementarity of all Tibetan Buddhist traditions, including Dzogchen and Mahamudra. The contemporary master **Mingyur Rinpoche** teaches within a framework that draws on both traditions.

## Relationship to Zen

Dzogchen and Mahamudra bear striking resemblances to the Zen tradition, particularly the practice of **shikantaza** ("just sitting") in the Soto Zen school. All three traditions share:

- An emphasis on the **already-awakened nature** of mind (Zen's "original face," Dzogchen's rigpa, Mahamudra's ordinary mind).
- The practice of **non-fabrication** -- sitting without an agenda, allowing the mind to rest in its natural state.
- A reliance on **direct transmission** from teacher to student (Zen's inka, Dzogchen and Mahamudra's ngo sprod).
- Skepticism toward gradual accumulation of merit or knowledge as the primary means of awakening.

Historical connections are debated. Some scholars have noted possible influence of Chinese Chan on early Dzogchen, particularly in the context of the **Council of Lhasa** (c. 792-794), where the Chan monk Moheyan debated the Indian gradualist Kamalashila. While the Tibetan tradition officially records Kamalashila as the victor, some Dzogchen teachings bear a resemblance to Chan's emphasis on sudden, non-conceptual awakening. However, Dzogchen masters are careful to distinguish their tradition from Chan, insisting that Dzogchen's rigpa is not mere mental blankness or the absence of thought but a vivid, luminous knowing.

## Relevance to Consciousness Studies

For researchers investigating the nature of consciousness, Dzogchen and Mahamudra offer several contributions of potential significance:

**Awareness as fundamental.** Both traditions treat awareness not as an epiphenomenon of neural processes but as a fundamental feature of reality. This resonates with contemporary proposals in philosophy of mind such as panpsychism, neutral monism, and certain interpretations of the "hard problem" of consciousness. Dzogchen's description of rigpa as having essence (emptiness), nature (luminosity), and energy (unceasing manifestation) provides a phenomenological framework that is more granular than anything available in Western philosophy.

**Self-liberation and metacognitive insight.** The Dzogchen principle that thoughts liberate upon arising -- without suppression, transformation, or engagement -- suggests a mode of metacognitive awareness that is distinct from both mindfulness-based attention regulation and cognitive-behavioral reappraisal. This may have implications for understanding how awareness relates to its contents and for clinical applications in psychological well-being.

**The observer problem.** Mahamudra's instruction to "look at the mind looking" produces a systematic encounter with the observer problem: when attention turns to investigate the one who is aware, no observer is found. The mind is empty of a findable subject. This phenomenological finding parallels discussions in neuroscience about the constructed nature of the self and the absence of a central "Cartesian theater."

**States vs. traits.** Both traditions distinguish between temporary meditative experiences (nyams) and stable realization (rtogs pa). This distinction maps onto the contemporary neuroscientific distinction between state effects (temporary changes during meditation) and trait effects (lasting transformations in baseline functioning), and both traditions insist that the goal is trait change -- a permanent shift in the practitioner's relationship to experience.

**Non-dual awareness as a natural capacity.** Perhaps most importantly, both Dzogchen and Mahamudra insist that non-dual awareness is not an exotic achievement but the natural condition of the mind. If this claim is taken seriously as a hypothesis, it suggests that the apparent duality of subject and object in ordinary experience is a constructed overlay -- and that methods exist for investigating what lies beneath that construction, using nothing more than awareness itself.
