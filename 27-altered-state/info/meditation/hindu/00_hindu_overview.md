# Hindu Consciousness Traditions: Overview

## Scope and Purpose

This directory documents the major Hindu philosophical traditions and their models of consciousness, extending beyond the non-dual traditions already covered in the `../non-dualism/` directory. While Advaita Vedanta and Kashmir Shaivism are treated in depth there, Hinduism contains a far richer range of positions on the nature of consciousness -- from strict dualism to qualified non-dualism to pure monism. This broader landscape is essential for any serious consciousness research program, because the tensions and disagreements between these schools illuminate aspects of consciousness that no single tradition captures alone.

The Hindu philosophical traditions are not merely historical artifacts. They represent twenty-five centuries of sustained, systematic investigation into the nature of awareness, selfhood, perception, and liberation. Each school developed its own epistemology (pramana theory), its own ontology, and its own soteriology -- and each was forced to defend these positions against rigorous philosophical opponents. The result is a body of thought about consciousness that is, in many respects, more detailed and more internally debated than anything the Western tradition produced before the twentieth century.

## The Six Orthodox Schools (Shad Darshana)

Hindu philosophy is traditionally organized into six orthodox (*astika*) schools, called *darshanas* (literally "viewpoints" or "ways of seeing"). These schools accept the authority of the Vedas, which distinguishes them from the heterodox (*nastika*) schools of Buddhism, Jainism, and Charvaka materialism.

### 1. Samkhya -- The Enumeration of Reality

**Founders**: Kapila (legendary), Ishvarakrishna (Samkhya-karika, c. 350 CE)

Samkhya is widely regarded as the oldest systematic philosophy in India. Its central claim is that reality consists of two irreducible principles: **Purusha** (pure consciousness, the witness) and **Prakriti** (nature, matter, the witnessed). This is an explicitly **dualist** ontology -- consciousness and matter are fundamentally different in kind and can never be reduced to one another. Liberation consists in the clear discrimination (*viveka*) between these two. Samkhya provides the theoretical foundation for classical Yoga and deeply influenced all subsequent Indian thought, including the traditions that rejected its dualism.

**Consciousness model**: Consciousness (purusha) is pure, unchanging, and passive. It does not act, think, or perceive. All mental activity belongs to prakriti. The apparent entanglement of consciousness with mental activity is the fundamental error that binds the soul.

### 2. Yoga -- The Discipline of Mind

**Founder**: Patanjali (Yoga Sutras, c. 200 BCE - 400 CE, dating disputed)

Yoga shares Samkhya's dualistic metaphysics but adds a practical, experiential dimension. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras define yoga as *chitta-vritti-nirodha* -- "the cessation of the fluctuations of mind-stuff." The eight-limbed (*ashtanga*) path provides a systematic technology for stilling the mind, purifying perception, and arriving at the direct discrimination between consciousness and its contents. The Yoga Sutras' analysis of mental states, attentional processes, and the stages of absorption (*samadhi*) constitutes one of the most detailed pre-modern cognitive architectures ever developed.

**Consciousness model**: Consciousness (purusha) is distinct from the mind (chitta). Mental activity is material, belonging to prakriti. Yoga practice progressively disentangles awareness from its identification with mental content.

### 3. Nyaya -- The Science of Reasoning

**Founder**: Gautama Akshapada (Nyaya Sutras, c. 2nd century BCE)

Nyaya is the Indian tradition of logic, epistemology, and analytic philosophy. It developed a rigorous theory of valid knowledge (*pramana*) based on four sources: perception (*pratyaksha*), inference (*anumana*), comparison (*upamana*), and testimony (*shabda*). Later Nyaya (Navya-Nyaya, "New Logic") developed one of the most sophisticated formal logical systems in the pre-modern world. Regarding consciousness, Nyaya holds that the self (*atman*) is a real substance distinct from the body and mind, and that consciousness is a quality (*guna*) that arises in the self when it is connected with the mind (*manas*) and senses.

**Consciousness model**: Consciousness is not the essential nature of the self but a contingent property that arises under certain conditions. In the liberated state, the self exists without consciousness -- a position that Advaita Vedanta and Kashmir Shaivism both found deeply problematic.

### 4. Vaisheshika -- The Atomist Philosophy

**Founder**: Kanada (Vaisheshika Sutras, c. 2nd century BCE)

Vaisheshika is an atomist and pluralist ontology that categorizes all of reality into six (later seven) categories (*padarthas*): substance, quality, action, universal, particular, inherence, and non-existence. It holds that the physical world is composed of eternal, indivisible atoms (*paramanu*) that combine to form all material objects. Regarding consciousness, Vaisheshika aligns with Nyaya: the self is a substance, and consciousness is an adventitious quality of the self, not its essence.

**Consciousness model**: Similar to Nyaya. The self is a real substance but is not inherently conscious. Consciousness arises through the conjunction of self, mind, and sense organs. Nyaya and Vaisheshika eventually merged into a composite system (Nyaya-Vaisheshika).

### 5. Mimamsa (Purva Mimamsa) -- The Exegesis of Ritual

**Founder**: Jaimini (Mimamsa Sutras, c. 3rd century BCE)

Mimamsa is primarily concerned with the interpretation of Vedic ritual texts and the philosophy of language. It developed a sophisticated theory of meaning, particularly the idea that the relationship between a word and its referent is eternal and intrinsic (*autpattika*). Regarding the self, the early Mimamsa thinker Kumarila Bhatta (7th century CE) held that the self is self-luminous (*svaprakasha*) -- a position that influenced later Advaita Vedanta. Prabhakara, another major Mimamsa philosopher, held that the self is known only in relation to its objects.

**Consciousness model**: The self is eternal and conscious, known through every act of cognition. Mimamsa does not seek liberation in the Vedantic sense but rather the attainment of heavenly rewards (*svarga*) through correct ritual performance. Its contributions to consciousness theory are primarily epistemological: the analysis of how cognition works, how error arises, and the self-certifying nature of valid knowledge.

### 6. Vedanta (Uttara Mimamsa) -- The End of the Vedas

**Founders**: Badarayana (Brahma Sutras), with major schools developed by Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, and others

Vedanta is the most philosophically developed and diverse of the six schools. The name means "end of the Vedas" and refers to the Upanishads, which form the concluding portions of the Vedic corpus. Vedanta encompasses a wide spectrum of positions on the nature of Brahman (ultimate reality), the self, and the world -- from the absolute non-dualism of Shankara to the strict dualism of Madhva, with several intermediate positions.

**Consciousness model**: Varies by sub-school. Advaita holds that consciousness is the sole reality (Brahman = pure awareness). Vishishtadvaita holds that consciousness is the essential attribute of Brahman but that individual souls and matter are also real. Dvaita holds that consciousness belongs to individual souls, which are eternally distinct from God.

## Relationship to the Non-Dualism Directory

The `../non-dualism/` directory covers traditions defined by their non-dual metaphysical position. This `hindu/` directory covers the full spectrum of Hindu philosophical positions, including those that are explicitly dualist. The overlap and the distinction are intentional:

- **Advaita Vedanta** appears in the non-dualism directory as a non-dual tradition alongside Zen, Dzogchen, and Taoism. It is not duplicated here but is cross-referenced.
- **Kashmir Shaivism** likewise appears in the non-dualism directory. Its tantric dimensions are further explored in `03_tantra_kundalini.md` here.
- **Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, and Mimamsa** are not non-dual traditions and appear only in this directory.
- **The Vedantic sub-schools** other than Advaita (Vishishtadvaita, Dvaita, Bhedabheda, etc.) are covered in `04_vedantic_schools.md`.
- **Bhakti traditions** bridge devotional practice with philosophical positions and are covered in `02_bhakti_traditions.md`.
- **Tantra and Kundalini** as broader phenomena (beyond their Kashmir Shaivism expression) are covered in `03_tantra_kundalini.md`.

## Integration with the Consciousness Project

Hindu philosophical traditions connect to the consciousness project's 40-form architecture at multiple points:

- **Form 01 (Sensory Consciousness)**: Samkhya's detailed analysis of the sense faculties (*indriyas*) and their objects
- **Form 07 (Emotional Consciousness)**: Bhakti traditions' investigation of devotional emotion as a consciousness-altering force; rasa theory
- **Form 11 (Meta-Consciousness)**: Samkhya's witness-consciousness (*sakshi*); Yoga's *pratyahara* (sensory withdrawal)
- **Form 13 (Integrated Information)**: The tattva systems (Samkhya's 25, Kashmir Shaivism's 36) as maps of information integration
- **Form 14 (Global Workspace)**: Yoga's model of *chitta* (mind-stuff) as a field in which mental content arises
- **Form 18 (Primary Consciousness)**: The Vedantic positions on whether consciousness is fundamental, derivative, or contingent
- **Form 27 (Altered State)**: Samadhi states in Yoga; kundalini experiences in Tantra; devotional ecstasy in Bhakti
- **Form 36 (Contemplative States)**: The full range of Hindu contemplative practices
