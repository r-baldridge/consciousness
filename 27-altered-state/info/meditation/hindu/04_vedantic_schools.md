# Vedantic Schools: The Full Spectrum of Brahman-Consciousness Positions

## 1. Overview

Vedanta (Sanskrit: *vedanta*, "end of the Vedas") is the philosophical tradition grounded in the interpretation of the Prasthanatrayi -- the "triple canon" consisting of the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras of Badarayana, and the Bhagavad Gita. Every Vedantic school is defined by its reading of these three texts, and the differences between the schools emerge from fundamentally different interpretations of the same scriptural foundation.

The diversity of Vedantic positions is remarkable. The same texts that Shankara reads as teaching absolute non-dualism, Madhva reads as teaching absolute dualism. The same Upanishadic declarations that Ramanuja interprets as asserting the organic unity of God, soul, and world, Vallabha interprets as asserting the pure divinity of all existence. This interpretive range is not a failure of the texts but evidence of their depth -- and of the genuine philosophical difficulty of the questions they address.

This document surveys the Vedantic schools **other than Advaita Vedanta**, which is already covered in `../non-dualism/01_advaita_vedanta.md`. Together, these schools map the full spectrum of possible positions on the relationship between consciousness (Brahman/Atman), individual souls, and the material world.

## 2. Vishishtadvaita: Qualified Non-Dualism

### Founder and Historical Context

**Ramanuja** (1017-1137 CE) is the most important philosopher of the Vishishtadvaita tradition and one of the greatest systematic thinkers in Indian intellectual history. Born in Sriperumbudur (near modern Chennai), Ramanuja was heir to the theological vision of the Tamil Alvars and the philosophical lineage of Nathamuni (c. 10th century) and Yamuna (c. 11th century). His philosophical project was to provide a rigorous metaphysical foundation for the devotional religion of the Alvars while countering what he regarded as the philosophical errors of Shankara's Advaita.

Ramanuja's major works include:
- **Sri Bhashya**: Commentary on the Brahma Sutras -- his magnum opus and the definitive statement of Vishishtadvaita philosophy
- **Vedarthasangraha** (Summary of the Meaning of the Vedas): An independent philosophical treatise
- **Gita Bhashya**: Commentary on the Bhagavad Gita
- **Vedanta Sara** and **Vedanta Dipa**: Shorter summaries of his philosophical position

### Core Philosophical Position

Vishishtadvaita means "non-dualism of the qualified" -- that is, Brahman is one, but Brahman is internally complex, qualified by real attributes. The relationship between Brahman and the world is not illusory (as Advaita claims) but organic: souls (*chit*) and matter (*achit*) are the **body** (*sharira*) of Brahman, who is their inner controller (*antaryamin*) and soul (*sharirin*).

Key distinctions from Advaita:

**On Brahman**: Brahman is not nirguna (without qualities) but **saguna** -- possessed of infinite auspicious qualities (*ananta-kalyana-guna*). Brahman is personal, identified with Narayana/Vishnu. The Upanishadic descriptions of Brahman as "neti neti" (not this, not this) do not negate all qualities but negate all imperfections and limitations.

**On Maya**: Ramanuja rejects the concept of maya as cosmic illusion. The world is real, not illusory. What Shankara calls maya, Ramanuja calls the real creative power (*prakriti*) of Brahman. The world is Brahman's body -- genuinely real, genuinely distinct from Brahman, yet inseparable from Brahman.

**On the Self**: Individual souls (*jivas*) are real, eternal, and conscious. They are not identical with Brahman (as Advaita claims) but are parts of Brahman -- related to Brahman as the body is related to the soul. Each soul is an "atomic" (*anu*) center of consciousness, distinct from other souls and from God, yet ontologically dependent on God for its existence.

**On Liberation**: Liberation (*moksha*) is not the dissolution of the individual self into undifferentiated Brahman but the soul's attainment of a direct, loving vision of God (*aparoksha-sakshatkar*) in the transcendent realm of Vaikuntha. The liberated soul retains its individual identity and enjoys eternal communion with God. The primary means of liberation are **bhakti** (loving devotion) and **prapatti** (total self-surrender to God's grace).

### Consciousness Model

For Ramanuja, consciousness (*jnana*) is the essential nature (*svarupa*) of the self, not a contingent property (as Nyaya-Vaisheshika holds). The soul is by nature a knowing subject. However, in the state of bondage, the soul's consciousness is **contracted** (*sankocha*) by karma, resulting in limited perception, ignorance, and suffering. Liberation is the expansion (*vikas*) of consciousness to its natural fullness, enabling the soul to know God directly.

This model has important implications for consciousness studies: consciousness is fundamental and inalienable (agreeing with Advaita), but it admits of degrees (disagreeing with Advaita, which holds that consciousness is always the same and only ignorance varies). The idea that consciousness can be contracted and expanded -- that the same fundamental awareness can operate at different levels of integration -- resonates with contemporary frameworks like Integrated Information Theory.

### Later Developments

The Vishishtadvaita tradition continued through important thinkers:
- **Vedanta Desika** (1268-1369): The greatest post-Ramanuja philosopher, author of the *Tattva-mukta-kalapa* and *Shatadushani* (Hundred Refutations of Advaita). He founded the **Vadakalai** (Northern) school, emphasizing active effort (*markata-nyaya*, the "monkey analogy" -- the baby monkey must cling to its mother)
- **Pillai Lokacharya** (1264-1327): Founded the **Tenkalai** (Southern) school, emphasizing passive surrender (*marjara-nyaya*, the "cat analogy" -- the mother cat carries the kitten, which does nothing)

The Vadakalai-Tenkalai split reflects a deep question about consciousness and agency: does liberation require the soul's active effort, or is it entirely a function of divine grace? This debate anticipates similar questions in Western theology (Pelagius vs. Augustine, Arminianism vs. Calvinism) and in consciousness studies (the role of volition and agency in consciousness transformation).

## 3. Dvaita: Dualism

### Founder and Historical Context

**Madhva** (1238-1317 CE), also known as Madhvacharya, Anandatirtha, and Purnaprajna, founded the Dvaita school -- the most rigorously realist and pluralist position within Vedanta. Born near Udupi in Karnataka, Madhva was a Brahmin of the Tulu-speaking community who became a sannyasin (renunciant) and devoted his intellectual career to dismantling what he regarded as the dangerous errors of Advaita.

Madhva's major works include:
- **Anuvyakhyana**: His most important independent philosophical work, a verse treatise on the Brahma Sutras
- **Brahma Sutra Bhashya**: Commentary on the Brahma Sutras
- **Gita Bhashya** and **Gita Tatparya**: Commentary and interpretive treatise on the Bhagavad Gita
- **Vishnu-tattva-vinirnaya**: A determination of the nature of Vishnu as the supreme reality

### Core Philosophical Position

Madhva's Dvaita ("dualism") holds that the five fundamental differences (*pancha-bheda*) -- between God and soul, God and matter, soul and soul, soul and matter, and matter and matter -- are **eternal and irreducible**. They are not the product of ignorance, not a provisional truth to be superseded, and not a lower-order reality. They are the ultimate structure of existence.

Key claims:

**On God**: Vishnu (also called Narayana or Hari) is the sole independent reality (*svatantra*). He is omniscient, omnipotent, and the source, sustainer, and destroyer of all else. He possesses infinite auspicious qualities. He is genuinely transcendent -- not merely a "higher perspective" on the same reality that constitutes the world and the soul.

**On the Soul**: Individual souls are real, eternal, and genuinely distinct from God. They possess consciousness as an essential attribute, but their consciousness is always finite and dependent on God. Souls are not created by God but are eternally existent, dependent entities. Crucially, Madhva holds that souls are inherently unequal -- they possess different intrinsic capacities and are destined for different ultimate fates.

**On Liberation and the Hierarchy of Souls**: Madhva's most distinctive and controversial doctrine is the **three-fold classification of souls** (*taratamya*):
- **Mukti-yogya** (fit for liberation): Souls capable of attaining liberation through the knowledge and grace of Vishnu
- **Nitya-samsarin** (eternally bound): Souls destined to remain in the cycle of birth and death forever
- **Tamo-yogya** (destined for darkness): Souls destined for eternal damnation in *andha-tamas* (blinding darkness)

This doctrine has no parallel in any other Vedantic school and has been the subject of intense controversy. It implies that consciousness -- at the level of the individual soul -- is not uniform but inherently graduated, and that not all beings possess the same capacity for spiritual development.

**On the World**: The world is entirely real, not illusory. Madhva's realism is robust: external objects exist independently of any mind that perceives them, and the diversity of the world reflects genuine ontological plurality, not the fragmentation of an underlying unity.

**On Advaita**: Madhva's critique of Advaita is among the most sustained and trenchant in Indian philosophy. He argues that the concept of maya as "neither real nor unreal" is logically incoherent; that the claim that Brahman is without qualities contradicts the Upanishadic texts that attribute qualities to Brahman; and that the Advaita path leads to spiritual nihilism by denying the reality of the soul, the world, and God.

### Consciousness Model

For Madhva, consciousness is a real attribute of real souls, and it is always **intentional** -- it is always consciousness *of* something. There is no such thing as pure, objectless consciousness (against Advaita) or consciousness stripped of all content (against Samkhya's kaivalya). Consciousness is relational by nature: it is the soul's inherent capacity to know objects, and this capacity is always directed toward a content.

This position resonates with the phenomenological tradition in Western philosophy (Brentano, Husserl), which holds that consciousness is always consciousness of something (*intentionality*). It also raises important questions for consciousness studies: is there a state of "pure consciousness" without any object, or is consciousness always and necessarily about something?

### Later Developments

The Dvaita tradition was developed by a lineage of brilliant philosophers:
- **Jayatirtha** (c. 1365-1388): The greatest commentator on Madhva's works, author of the *Nyaya Sudha* and *Tattva Prakashika*
- **Vyasatirtha** (1460-1539): Author of the *Nyayamrita* (Nectar of Logic), a devastating critique of Advaita that prompted Madhusudana Sarasvati's *Advaita Siddhi* in response. The Nyayamrita-Advaita Siddhi-Tarangini exchange (Vyasatirtha-Madhusudana-Ramacharya) is considered the pinnacle of dialectical philosophy in India
- **Raghavendra Swami** (1595-1671): A revered saint-philosopher whose commentaries on Jayatirtha's works remain authoritative

## 4. Bhedabheda: Difference and Non-Difference

### Overview

**Bhedabheda** ("difference and non-difference") is a family of Vedantic positions that hold that Brahman and the world (including individual souls) are **simultaneously different and non-different**. This is not a compromise between Advaita and Dvaita but a distinct metaphysical claim: the relationship between the whole and its parts, or between the cause and its effects, is one of genuine identity-in-difference.

### Nimbarka (c. 12th-13th century CE)

**Nimbarka**, also known as Nimbaditya or Nimbarka Acharya, founded the **Dvaitadvaita** ("duality-and-non-duality") school. His commentary on the Brahma Sutras, the *Vedanta-parijata-saurabha*, presents the position that Brahman (identified with Krishna) is both different from and non-different from souls and the world. The analogy is of the sun and its rays: the rays are genuinely distinct from the sun (you can be in sunlight without being on the sun) yet inseparable from it (rays cannot exist without the sun, and the sun is defined by its capacity to radiate).

For Nimbarka:
- Brahman is Krishna, the supreme personal God
- Souls and matter are real and are both different from and identical with Brahman
- The three categories -- God (*ishvara*), soul (*jiva*), and matter (*jagat*) -- are equally real
- Liberation is the soul's experience of divine love in the company of Krishna, achieved through *prapatti* (surrender) and devotion

### Bhaskara (c. 9th century CE)

**Bhaskara** was an early Bhedabheda thinker whose commentary on the Brahma Sutras predates most other Vedantic schools. He argued that Brahman really transforms (*parinama*) into the world, and that the world is both identical with and different from Brahman -- as the ocean is both identical with and different from its waves. Bhaskara was a strong critic of Shankara, arguing that the maya doctrine undermines both morality and devotion.

## 5. Shuddhadvaita: Pure Non-Dualism

### Founder: Vallabha (1479-1531 CE)

**Vallabha**, also known as Vallabhacharya, founded the **Shuddhadvaita** ("pure non-dualism") school -- a position that appears superficially similar to Shankara's Advaita but differs on a crucial point. Like Advaita, Shuddhadvaita holds that Brahman (identified with Krishna) is the sole reality. Unlike Advaita, it holds that the world is **real and divine** -- not an illusory appearance but a genuine manifestation of Brahman's own being.

Key works:
- **Anubhashya**: Vallabha's commentary on the Brahma Sutras
- **Subodhini**: Commentary on the Bhagavata Purana (Srimad Bhagavatam)
- **Tattvartha-dipa-nibandha**: A detailed exposition of his philosophical system

### Core Philosophical Position

The "pure" (*shuddha*) in Shuddhadvaita refers to a non-dualism purified of the concept of maya. For Vallabha, Shankara's introduction of maya as cosmic illusion is an unnecessary and philosophically damaging addition to the Upanishadic teaching. The Upanishads teach that Brahman is all -- and this means the world is Brahman, not that the world is an illusion projected by Brahman.

Key claims:
- **Brahman is Krishna** -- the supreme personal God, possessed of infinite qualities, whose essential nature is *sat-chit-ananda* (existence-consciousness-bliss)
- **The world is Brahman**: Not an emanation from Brahman, not an illusion superimposed on Brahman, but Brahman itself in its creative self-expression. The world is Brahman as gold is the ring -- the material cause is identical with its effect
- **Maya is not illusion but divine power**: Maya is God's capacity to appear as the many without ceasing to be the one. It is a positive, creative power, not a veil of ignorance
- **Souls are "parts" (*amsha*) of Brahman**: Each soul is a spark of the divine fire -- genuinely divine in nature but, in the bound state, unaware of its divinity
- **Liberation is grace (*pushti*)**: Vallabha's path is called **Pushti Marga** (the Path of Grace). Liberation comes not through the soul's own effort but through the direct grace of Krishna, who reveals the soul's divine nature. The soul's role is to cultivate love and surrender; the rest is God's work

### Consciousness Model

Vallabha's position on consciousness is distinctive: because the world is genuinely Brahman, consciousness pervades everything. There is no unconscious matter, no inert prakriti standing opposite to conscious purusha. Matter is Brahman concealing its consciousness (*sat* and *chit* are suppressed; only *sat* remains manifest). Liberation is the full manifestation of all three aspects -- existence, consciousness, and bliss -- in what was previously experienced as merely existent.

This is a form of panpsychism (or more precisely, cosmopsychism) that differs from Advaita's approach. For Advaita, the world has no consciousness because the world is not real. For Vallabha, the world has concealed consciousness because the world *is* Brahman but in a mode where consciousness is not manifest. The latency of consciousness in matter, rather than its absence, is the cause of the world's apparent inertness.

## 6. Achintya-Bhedabheda: Inconceivable Simultaneous Difference and Non-Difference

### Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and the Gaudiya Vaishnava Tradition

This school is introduced in `02_bhakti_traditions.md` in the context of devotional consciousness. Here the philosophical position is treated in more detail.

**Chaitanya Mahaprabhu** (1486-1534) is regarded by his followers as an incarnation of Krishna who appeared to teach the path of congregational chanting (*sankirtana*) and ecstatic devotion. His philosophical position -- **achintya-bhedabheda** -- was systematized by his followers, particularly **Jiva Gosvami** (c. 1513-1598) in the *Sat-sandarbha* and **Baladeva Vidyabhushana** (c. 18th century) in the *Govinda Bhashya* (a commentary on the Brahma Sutras).

### Philosophical Position

The central claim is that the relationship between God (Krishna), souls, and matter is one of **simultaneous, inconceivable difference and non-difference**. "Inconceivable" (*achintya*) is not a philosophical evasion but a technical term: the simultaneous co-existence of identity and difference is a genuine feature of ultimate reality that exceeds the capacity of ordinary rational analysis, just as the nature of consciousness itself exceeds purely physical explanation.

Key metaphysical principles (as developed by Jiva Gosvami):

**Shakti-parinamavada** (transformation of divine energy): The world is not a transformation of Brahman's essence (*svarupa*) but of Brahman's **energy** (*shakti*). This allows the world to be genuinely real and genuinely divine without compromising Brahman's transcendence. Krishna remains unchanged even as his energies transform into the manifest world.

**Three-fold energy** (*tri-shakti*):
1. **Svarupa-shakti** (internal energy): The transcendent realm of God -- sat (existence/sandhinya), chit (consciousness/samvit), and ananda (bliss/hladini)
2. **Jiva-shakti** (marginal energy): The individual souls, situated at the border between the internal and external energies -- capable of orientation toward either
3. **Maya-shakti** (external energy): The material world -- not illusory but the real, though inferior, energy of God

**Consciousness model**: The soul (*jiva*) is both identical with and different from God. It shares God's nature (consciousness, bliss) but not God's fullness (omniscience, omnipotence). The soul is a "marginal" (*tatastha*) energy, possessing the peculiar capacity to align itself with either the internal energy (leading to liberation) or the external energy (leading to bondage). This model of consciousness as inherently "marginal" -- suspended between two poles, capable of orientation in either direction -- is a distinctive contribution to consciousness theory.

## 7. Neo-Vedanta: Modern Interpretations

### Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902)

**Vivekananda** was the foremost disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and the figure most responsible for introducing Vedanta to the Western world. His contribution is less a new philosophical system than a **reframing** of the Vedantic tradition for modernity.

Key innovations:
- **Practical Vedanta**: The claim that Vedantic realization must express itself in social action -- service to humanity (*seva*) is service to God, because all beings are Brahman. This reversed the traditional emphasis on world-renunciation
- **Universal religion**: The claim that all religions are paths to the same truth, with Advaita Vedanta as the most comprehensive philosophical framework for understanding this unity
- **Four yogas**: Systematizing the paths of jnana, bhakti, karma, and raja yoga as complementary approaches suited to different temperaments -- a synthesis drawn from the Gita but given a new, egalitarian framing
- **The divinity of the self**: Emphasizing the Upanishadic teaching that the self is divine -- not as a metaphysical abstraction but as a basis for human dignity, self-confidence, and social reform

Vivekananda's consciousness model is essentially Advaitic -- consciousness is Brahman, and individual multiplicity is appearance -- but he adds a developmental dimension: humanity is progressing toward the collective realization of its divine nature.

### Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950)

**Aurobindo Ghose**, known as Sri Aurobindo, developed the most ambitious and original modern reinterpretation of Vedantic philosophy. A Cambridge-educated revolutionary who became a mystic and philosopher, Aurobindo combined Vedantic metaphysics, evolutionary theory, and his own meditative experiences into a system called **Integral Yoga** or **Purna Yoga** (complete yoga).

Key concepts:

**Involution and Evolution**: Aurobindo's central insight is that the descent (*involution*) of consciousness into matter is followed by the ascent (*evolution*) of consciousness back toward its source. Biological evolution is the surface expression of a deeper process: the progressive emergence of consciousness through matter, life, mind, and beyond mind. Evolution has not stopped with the human mind; it is heading toward what Aurobindo calls the **Supramental** consciousness.

**The Supermind**: Above the ordinary mind are levels of consciousness that Aurobindo maps in detail:
- **Higher Mind**: Luminous thought -- ideas perceived as living realities rather than abstract concepts
- **Illumined Mind**: Vision rather than thought -- direct perception of spiritual truth in images, light, and energy
- **Intuition**: Direct knowledge without the mediation of thought -- immediate contact with the essence of things
- **Overmind**: The plane of the gods and cosmic consciousness -- a luminous, diversified consciousness in which unity and multiplicity coexist
- **Supermind** (Supramental): The highest integrative consciousness, in which the unity of Brahman and the multiplicity of the world are perfectly reconciled. This is not a human possibility through individual effort alone; it requires a **descent** of supramental force into the earth-consciousness, transforming matter itself

**The Triple Transformation**: Aurobindo describes three stages of spiritual transformation:
1. *Psychic transformation*: The emergence of the psychic being (the evolving soul) as the center of the personality, replacing the ego
2. *Spiritual transformation*: The opening of consciousness to the transcendent Brahman -- experiences of silence, vastness, and unity
3. *Supramental transformation*: The descent of the supramental consciousness into the body and mind, transforming the very cells of the body into expressions of divine consciousness

**Major works**:
- **The Life Divine**: Aurobindo's philosophical masterwork -- over 1,000 pages of systematic metaphysics integrating Vedanta with evolutionary thought
- **The Synthesis of Yoga**: A comprehensive treatment of the various paths of yoga and their integration
- **Savitri**: An epic poem of over 24,000 lines, described by Aurobindo as a "legend and a symbol" -- a spiritual narrative that embodies his vision of the evolution of consciousness

### Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888-1975)

**Radhakrishnan**, the philosopher who became the second President of India, was the most influential academic interpreter of Indian philosophy in the twentieth century. His major work, *An Idealist View of Life* (1932), and his two-volume *Indian Philosophy* (1923-1927) shaped the global perception of Vedanta.

Radhakrishnan's contribution is primarily interpretive:
- He presented Advaita Vedanta as India's most important philosophical tradition, comparable to and compatible with Western idealism (Plato, Hegel, Bradley)
- He argued that mystical experience is the foundation of all religion, and that the differences between religions are differences of interpretation, not of ultimate experience
- He emphasized the experiential dimension of Vedanta -- it is not merely a philosophy but a report of what can be directly known through contemplative practice

## 9. How These Positions Map onto the Consciousness Project

The Vedantic schools collectively address several of the consciousness project's central questions:

**Is consciousness fundamental or derived?** All Vedantic schools agree that consciousness is fundamental, not a product of material processes. But they disagree on whether there is one consciousness (Advaita), one consciousness with real internal complexity (Vishishtadvaita, Shuddhadvaita), or many irreducibly distinct consciousnesses (Dvaita, Samkhya).

**Is consciousness identical with its contents?** Advaita says no -- consciousness is the contentless ground. Madhva says consciousness is always intentional, always *of* something. Ramanuja holds a middle position: consciousness is the soul's essential nature, but the soul is always in relation to God and the world.

**Can consciousness exist without a self?** All Vedantic schools posit a real self (*atman*). They disagree on whether this self is identical with the universal consciousness (Advaita), a part of it (Vishishtadvaita, Shuddhadvaita), or an irreducibly distinct entity (Dvaita).

**Is the world conscious?** Vallabha's Shuddhadvaita offers a form of panpsychism: everything is Brahman, and therefore everything is, at some level, conscious -- though in matter, consciousness is concealed. Other schools draw a sharper line between conscious (chit) and unconscious (achit/jada) entities.

**What is liberation?** The schools' answers range from the dissolution of individuality (Advaita) through the perfection of relationship (Vishishtadvaita, Gaudiya Vaishnavism) to the realization of inherent hierarchy (Dvaita). Each model implies a different theory of what consciousness *is for* and what its optimal state looks like.
