# Altered State Consciousness - Behavioral Indicators

## Comprehensive Framework for Observable Consciousness State Indicators

### Executive Overview

This framework establishes systematic behavioral indicators for validating altered states of consciousness, particularly those arising from contemplative practices. The indicators provide observable, measurable criteria for recognizing authentic meditation states, developmental progress, and therapeutic outcomes while honoring traditional contemplative wisdom and maintaining scientific rigor.
