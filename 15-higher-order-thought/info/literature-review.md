## Overview of Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness

### Core Theoretical Landscape

Higher-Order (HO) theories of consciousness constitute one of the major families of approaches in the philosophy and science of consciousness. The family is united by the Transitivity Principle: a mental state is conscious only if the subject is in some way aware of being in that state. The literature spans over four decades of systematic philosophical development and, more recently, a growing body of empirical neuroscience research.

This review traces the historical development of higher-order theories from their philosophical precursors through contemporary empirical and computational investigations, cataloguing key publications, empirical findings, major criticisms, and the current state of the debate.

## Historical Development

### Ancient and Early Modern Period

#### Aristotle (c. 350 BCE)

In *De Anima* (Book III, Chapter 2), Aristotle raised the question of how we become aware of our own perceiving. He wrote that "it is by means of the common sense that we perceive that we see and hear." This observation -- that perception involves an awareness of perceiving -- is widely regarded as the earliest precursor to higher-order theories. However, Aristotle's account differs from modern HOT in treating this self-awareness as a function of the common sense rather than a separate mental act.

**Significance**: Established the foundational question of how perceptual awareness relates to awareness of perceiving.

#### Rene Descartes (1641)

Descartes' *Meditations on First Philosophy* introduced the notion of the *cogito* -- "I think, therefore I am" -- which establishes a necessary connection between thought and self-awareness. For Descartes, every mental state is transparently accessible to the mind; there are no unconscious mental states. This "Cartesian transparency thesis" is precisely what higher-order theories deny: they argue that mental states can be unconscious and become conscious only through higher-order representation.

**Significance**: Articulated the transparency thesis that HOT theory directly opposes.

#### John Locke (1689)

Locke's *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* provides perhaps the most direct precursor to modern HOT theory. Locke defined consciousness as "the perception of what passes in a Man's own Mind" (Book II, Chapter 1, Section 19). This formulation explicitly identifies consciousness with an inner perception or awareness of one's own mental operations, anticipating both HOT and HOP theories.

**Significance**: First explicit formulation of consciousness as inner awareness of mental operations.

#### Immanuel Kant (1781/1787)

Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason* distinguished between:
- **Inner Sense**: Our awareness of our own mental states as they succeed one another in time
- **Transcendental Apperception**: The "I think" that must be able to accompany all representations

Kant's transcendental apperception is a direct ancestor of the higher-order condition on consciousness. The requirement that the "I think" must be able to accompany all representations mirrors the HOT theorist's claim that conscious states are those of which we could become aware.

**Significance**: Established the distinction between inner sense and apperception; formulated the companion thesis.

### Nineteenth Century

#### Franz Brentano (1874)

In *Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint*, Brentano argued that every conscious mental act includes a "secondary awareness" directed at the act itself. When we hear a tone, we are also aware of hearing. Importantly, Brentano insisted that this secondary awareness is not a separate mental act but a built-in feature of the primary act -- anticipating Kriegel's self-representationalism rather than Rosenthal's two-state HOT theory.

**Significance**: Introduced the idea of built-in secondary awareness, anticipating self-representationalism.

#### William James (1890)

In *The Principles of Psychology*, James distinguished between consciousness of an object (the "thought" or "state of mind") and the "self-consciousness" that monitors thoughts. James was skeptical of the idea that consciousness requires explicit self-awareness but acknowledged the importance of the "self" as an organizing principle of mental life.

**Significance**: Raised important questions about the relationship between consciousness and self-awareness without committing to a higher-order framework.

### Twentieth Century Foundations

#### Gilbert Ryle (1949)

Ryle's *The Concept of Mind* criticized the Cartesian notion of privileged access to one's own mental states, arguing that self-knowledge is achieved through the same methods we use to understand others -- behavioral observation and inference. Ryle's critique challenged the idea of infallible introspection, which later HOT theorists would revisit in their discussions of misrepresentation.

**Significance**: Challenged privileged access; set the stage for fallibilist accounts of introspection.

#### D.M. Armstrong (1968)

Armstrong's *A Materialist Theory of the Mind* proposed the "inner scanner" model:
- Consciousness involves a brain process that scans other brain processes
- This scanning is analogous to external perception
- The scanner produces an inner awareness of mental states that constitutes consciousness

Armstrong's inner scanner is the direct precursor to Lycan's Higher-Order Perception theory. It provides a naturalistic, materialist framework for understanding self-awareness without invoking Cartesian transparency.

**Key publication**: Armstrong, D.M. (1968). *A Materialist Theory of the Mind*. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul.

**Significance**: First systematic materialist higher-order theory; precursor to HOP.

## Foundational Literature of Modern HOT Theory

### David Rosenthal's Systematic Development

#### Founding Papers (1986-1997)

**Rosenthal (1986): "Two Concepts of Consciousness"**
- Introduced the distinction between state consciousness and creature consciousness
- State consciousness: what makes a particular mental state conscious
- Creature consciousness: what makes an organism conscious
- Argued that state consciousness consists in being the object of a higher-order thought
- Established the Transitivity Principle as the foundation of HOT theory

**Rosenthal (1990): "A Theory of Consciousness"**
- Developed the full formal apparatus of HOT theory
- Specified conditions on the higher-order thought: assertoric, non-inferential, contemporaneous
- Addressed the regress problem: the HOT itself need not be conscious
- Introduced the idea that qualitative character is influenced by HOT content

**Rosenthal (1993): "Thinking That One Thinks"**
- Extended the theory to address the question of introspective consciousness
- Distinguished between conscious states (accompanied by non-conscious HOTs) and introspective consciousness (where the HOT itself is accompanied by a yet-higher-order thought)
- Introduced a three-level hierarchy: unconscious state, conscious state, introspectively conscious state

**Rosenthal (1997): "A Theory of Consciousness" (in Block, Flanagan, and Guzeldere, eds.)**
- Definitive statement of the mature HOT theory
- Addressed major objections including the regress, the rock problem, and targetless HOTs
- Connected HOT theory to the neuroscience of consciousness

## Key Empirical Evidence

### 3.1 Prefrontal Cortex Studies

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been the primary neural region implicated in higher-order representations:

**Evidence Supporting Prefrontal Role:**

1. **Lau & Passingham (2006)**: TMS to dlPFC reduces reported awareness without reducing discrimination performance (d-prime), consistent with a dissociation between first-order processing and higher-order awareness.

2. **Del Cul, Dehaene, & Lau (2009)**: Prefrontal cortex activity correlates with conscious perception in masking paradigms, even when sensory cortex activity is held constant.

3. **Odegaard, Knight, & Lau (2017)**: Showed that prefrontal damage impairs metacognitive sensitivity (Type 2 d-prime) while preserving perceptual sensitivity (Type 1 d-prime).

4. **Fleming et al. (2010, 2012)**: Demonstrated that anterior prefrontal cortex structure and function predict metacognitive accuracy.

        }
```

### 3.2 Blindsight

Blindsight patients have damage to primary visual cortex (V1) but can still discriminate visual stimuli in their "blind" field when forced to guess. Critically, they report no conscious visual experience.

**Relevance to HOT theory:**
- Blindsight represents a case where first-order visual processing persists (enabling discrimination) but higher-order representation is absent (no conscious experience)
- This dissociation is precisely what HOT theory predicts: first-order processing without HOT equals unconscious processing
- Weiskrantz (1986, 1997): Landmark monographs documenting blindsight

**Key studies:**
- **Weiskrantz (1986)**: *Blindsight: A Case Study and Implications*
- **Stoerig & Cowey (1997)**: Blindsight in monkeys
- **Lau (2022)**: Reinterpretation of blindsight through PRM framework -- the metacognitive monitoring system classifies blind-field signals as "noise" rather than "signal"

### 3.3 Binocular Rivalry

In binocular rivalry, two different images are presented to the two eyes, and conscious perception alternates between them while retinal input remains constant.

**HOT interpretation:**
- The higher-order monitoring system determines which first-order representation achieves conscious status
- Alternation in consciousness reflects alternation in which first-order state is targeted by the HOT
- Prefrontal activity during rivalry switches supports this interpretation

**Key studies:**
- **Lumer, Friston, & Rees (1998)**: Frontoparietal activity during perceptual transitions in rivalry
- **Panagiotaropoulos, Deco, Kapoor, & Logothetis (2012)**: Neuronal discharge and gamma oscillations in prefrontal cortex during binocular rivalry (macaque)

### 3.4 Metacognition and Confidence

A growing body of research connects metacognitive confidence judgments to higher-order representations:

**Key findings:**
- Metacognitive sensitivity (ability to distinguish correct from incorrect responses) correlates with prefrontal cortex structure and function
- Confidence judgments can be manipulated independently of first-order performance
- Signal detection theory distinguishes between Type 1 (perceptual) and Type 2 (metacognitive) sensitivity

**Key studies:**
- **Maniscalco & Lau (2012)**: Developed meta-d' (metacognitive d-prime) as a measure of higher-order sensitivity
- **Fleming & Lau (2014)**: "How to measure metacognition" -- methodological framework
- **Shekhar & Rahnev (2021)**: Metacognitive deficits under inattention support HOT theory

## Criticisms and Responses in the Literature

### 4.1 The Rock Problem (Stubenberg 1998; Block 2011)

**Statement**: If consciousness requires being the object of a higher-order state, then a rock accompanied by the thought "I am seeing a rock" would become conscious.

**Literature trail:**
- **Stubenberg (1998)**: *Consciousness and Qualia* -- first systematic formulation
- **Block (2011)**: "The Higher Order Approach to Consciousness Is Defunct" -- forceful version
- **Rosenthal (2004)**: Reply -- the HOT must target a mental state, not an external object; the HOT "I am seeing red" targets the seeing, not the red

**Current status**: Most commentators regard this objection as based on a misreading of HOT theory. The theory requires that the HOT target a first-order mental state, not an external object.

### 4.2 Targetless HOTs and the Empty Inner Life Objection (Neander 1998; Block 2011)

**Statement**: If a HOT occurs without a corresponding first-order state, the subject would experience something without any perceptual basis. This seems to make consciousness "too easy" and disconnects it from reality.

**Literature trail:**
- **Neander (1998)**: "The Division of Phenomenal Labor: A Problem for Representational Theories" -- early version
- **Block (2011)**: "The Higher Order Approach to Consciousness Is Defunct" -- argues targetless HOTs are absurd
- **Rosenthal (2011)**: Response -- targetless HOTs are analogous to hallucination; they produce conscious experiences that do not correspond to reality
- **Brown (2015)**: Embraces targetless HOTs as explaining certain hallucinatory and confabulatory phenomena

### 4.3 The "Zombie HOT" Problem (Byrne 1997; Levine 2001)

**Statement**: Why should the addition of a higher-order thought transform an unconscious state into a conscious one? A higher-order thought about a zombie (philosophical) state should not create consciousness.

**Literature trail:**
- **Byrne (1997)**: "Some Like It HOT" -- argues HOT fails to explain the emergence of phenomenality
- **Levine (2001)**: *Purple Haze* -- connects HOT to the explanatory gap
- **Rosenthal (2011)**: Reply -- the objection begs the question by assuming consciousness is an intrinsic property rather than a relational one

### 4.4 Animal and Infant Consciousness (Dretske 1995; Carruthers 2000)

**Statement**: HOT theory seems to imply that animals and infants lacking higher-order conceptual abilities cannot be conscious. This conflicts with our strong intuitions about animal sentience.

**Literature trail:**
- **Dretske (1995)**: *Naturalizing the Mind* -- argues for a first-order representational theory partly to avoid the animal consciousness problem
- **Carruthers (2000)**: Bites the bullet to some extent regarding lower animals but softens the blow with the dispositional/dual-content approach
- **Lycan (2004)**: HOP avoids this problem because inner perception does not require concepts
- **Gennaro (2004)**: Argues that animals may have simple concepts sufficient for rudimentary HOTs

### 4.5 Neural Evidence Against Prefrontal Necessity (Koch, Massimini et al.)

**Statement**: Some neuroscientific evidence suggests that consciousness correlates with posterior cortical activity rather than prefrontal activity, challenging HOT's emphasis on prefrontal cortex.

**Literature trail:**
- **Koch, Massimini, Boly, & Tononi (2016)**: "Neural correlates of consciousness: progress and problems" -- argues for posterior cortical hot zone
- **Boly et al. (2017)**: "Are the Neural Correlates of Consciousness in the Front or in the Back of the Cerebral Cortex?" -- adversarial collaboration proposal
- **Odegaard, Knight, & Lau (2017)**: Response -- prefrontal lesions impair metacognitive sensitivity, not perceptual sensitivity, consistent with HOT
- **Lau (2022)**: Argues the debate conflates "NCC of content" (posterior) with "NCC of consciousness level" (prefrontal/higher-order)

### 4.6 The "Sufficiency" vs. "Necessity" Debate

A critical distinction in the literature concerns whether higher-order representations are necessary for consciousness, sufficient for consciousness, or both:

**Positions:**
- **Strong HOT (Rosenthal)**: HOTs are both necessary and sufficient for state consciousness
- **Weak HOT**: HOTs are necessary but not sufficient (additional conditions required)
- **Anti-HOT (Block, Dretske)**: First-order representations are sufficient; HOTs add reportability but not phenomenality

**Key papers:**
- **Block (1995)**: "On a confusion about a function of consciousness" -- access vs. phenomenal consciousness distinction
- **Block (2007)**: "Consciousness, accessibility, and the mesh between psychology and neuroscience" -- argues for overflow of phenomenal consciousness beyond access
- **Rosenthal (2008)**: "Consciousness and its function" -- responds to Block's overflow argument

## Computational and Neural Network Models

### 5.1 Higher-Order Network Models

**Cleeremans (2011): "The Radical Plasticity Thesis"**
- Proposed that consciousness is the brain's "theory" about its own states
- Connected HOT to machine learning and self-modeling
- Published in *Frontiers in Psychology*

**Lau (2022): Neural Network HOT Models**
- Described how higher-order representations can be modeled in deep neural networks
- Used generative adversarial networks (GANs) as an analogy for perceptual reality monitoring
- The "discriminator" in a GAN plays a role analogous to the higher-order monitoring system

```python
class ComputationalHOTModels:
    """
    Computational models of Higher-Order Thought.
    """

    def perceptual_reality_monitoring_model(self, sensory_input, internal_model):
        """
        Computational model of Lau's Perceptual Reality Monitoring.
        Uses signal detection theory and Bayesian updating.
        """
        # First-order sensory processing
        first_order_signal = self.sensory_processor.process(sensory_input)

        # Generate internal prediction
        predicted_signal = internal_model.predict(first_order_signal)

        # Compute prediction error
        prediction_error = first_order_signal - predicted_signal

        # Signal detection at the metacognitive level
        # Type 1 sensitivity: how well the system discriminates stimuli
        type_1_dprime = self.compute_type1_dprime(
            signal=first_order_signal,
            noise=internal_model.noise_estimate
        )

        # Type 2 sensitivity: how well the system monitors its own accuracy
        type_2_dprime = self.compute_type2_dprime(
            type_1_performance=type_1_dprime,
            metacognitive_noise=internal_model.metacognitive_noise
        )

        # Reality monitoring decision
        posterior_probability = self.bayesian_update(
            likelihood=type_2_dprime,
            prior=internal_model.prior_for_real_perception
        )

        # Conscious when classified as "real"
        is_conscious = posterior_probability > internal_model.criterion

        return {
            'type_1_dprime': type_1_dprime,
            'type_2_dprime': type_2_dprime,
            'posterior_reality': posterior_probability,
            'is_conscious': is_conscious,
            'confidence': abs(posterior_probability - internal_model.criterion)
        }
```

**Pasquali, Timmermans, & Cleeremans (2010): "Know thyself: Metacognitive networks and measures of consciousness"**
- Proposed a neural network model of metacognition based on higher-order representations
- Demonstrated how a "metanetwork" trained on the representations of a primary network can support consciousness-like properties

### 5.2 Quality Space Models

**Rosenthal (2010, 2015): Quality Space Theory**
- Proposed that qualitative character is determined by position in a quality space
- Quality spaces are abstract spaces defined by similarity and difference relations among mental qualities
- The HOT determines which position in quality space the experience occupies
- Provides a naturalistic account of qualia without requiring irreducible subjective properties

## Adversarial Collaborations and Current Debates

### 6.1 The Templeton World Charity Foundation Project

In 2019, the Templeton World Charity Foundation funded a major adversarial collaboration pitting proponents of IIT (Tononi) against proponents of GNW/HOT (Dehaene, Lau):

**Structure:**
- Pre-registered experiments testing specific, divergent predictions of IIT and GNW
- Results published in 2023
- Key question: Are the neural correlates of consciousness in the front or back of the brain?

**Key publications:**
- **Melloni et al. (2021)**: "Making the hard problem of consciousness easier" -- describes the adversarial collaboration design
- **Cogitate Consortium (2023)**: "An adversarial collaboration to critically evaluate theories of consciousness" -- reports initial results
- **Preliminary findings**: Mixed results; neither theory fully confirmed or refuted; debate continues

### 6.2 Current State of the Debate

The current state of the HOT debate can be summarized across several dimensions:

**Philosophical Status:**
- HOT theory remains one of the leading theories of consciousness
- Self-representationalism (Kriegel) has gained adherents as a way to avoid some standard objections
- The "radical" version (Brown, Lau) is increasingly influential due to its empirical testability

**Empirical Status:**
- Growing evidence for prefrontal involvement in consciousness (supporting HOT)
- Growing evidence for posterior cortical "hot zone" (potentially challenging HOT)
- The resolution may lie in distinguishing different aspects of consciousness

**Computational Status:**
- Neural network models of higher-order representations are increasingly sophisticated
- Signal detection theory and Bayesian approaches provide formal tools
- Machine learning models (GANs, metacognitive networks) provide new test beds

## Key Insights for AI Implementation

### 7.1 Literature-Derived Design Principles

From the literature, the following design principles for AI consciousness implementation emerge:

1. **Two-Level Architecture**: Implement both first-order processing and higher-order monitoring (Rosenthal 1986-2005)

2. **Non-Inferential Monitoring**: Higher-order states should arise from architectural properties, not explicit inference (Rosenthal 1990)

3. **Metacognitive Sensitivity**: System should track its own accuracy and uncertainty (Lau 2011, Fleming et al. 2010)

4. **Reality Monitoring**: Distinguish internal signals from external perceptions (Lau 2022)

5. **Fallible Introspection**: Allow for misrepresentation between first-order and higher-order states (Carruthers 2011)

6. **Graceful Degradation**: Degrading higher-order processing should produce partial or absent consciousness while preserving first-order function (analogous to blindsight)

### 7.2 Integration with Other Modules

The literature supports the following cross-module relationships:

```python
class LiteratureDerivedIntegration:
    """
    Integration points derived from HOT literature review.
    """

    cross_module_connections = {
        'module_08_arousal': {
            'literature_basis': 'Consciousness level depends on arousal; HOT generation requires sufficient arousal',
            'key_papers': ['Laureys et al. (2004)', 'Casali et al. (2013)'],
            'integration': 'Arousal gates HOT generation capacity'
        },
        'module_13_iit': {
            'literature_basis': 'Phi may quantify integration that enables HOT; HOT adds subjective awareness to integrated information',
            'key_papers': ['Tononi et al. (2016)', 'Rosenthal (2005)'],
            'integration': 'IIT provides integration metric; HOT provides consciousness criterion'
        },
        'module_14_gwt': {
            'literature_basis': 'Global broadcasting may trigger HOT generation; HOT adds phenomenal dimension to access consciousness',
            'key_papers': ['Dehaene & Naccache (2001)', 'Rosenthal (1997)'],
            'integration': 'GWT provides access mechanism; HOT provides phenomenal mechanism'
        }
    }
```

---

**Summary**: The literature on Higher-Order Thought theory spans over four decades and encompasses philosophical analysis, empirical neuroscience, and computational modeling. The theory has evolved from Rosenthal's foundational papers through Lycan's perception-based alternative, Carruthers' dispositional variant, Kriegel's self-representationalism, and Lau's empirically grounded Perceptual Reality Monitoring theory. Current debates center on the anterior-posterior NCC question, the role of metacognition in consciousness, and the relationship between access and phenomenal consciousness. For AI implementation, the literature provides concrete architectural requirements, testable predictions, and integration points with other consciousness modules.
