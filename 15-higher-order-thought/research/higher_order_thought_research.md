## 1. Scientific Foundation

### 1.1 Key Researchers and Their Contributions

**David Rosenthal** (City University of New York) is the most systematic developer of Higher-Order Thought theory proper. Beginning with "Two Concepts of Consciousness" (1986), Rosenthal articulated the foundational distinction between state consciousness (what makes a particular mental state conscious) and creature consciousness (what makes an organism conscious). His central thesis is that a mental state is conscious when it is the target of an appropriate higher-order thought (HOT) -- a thought with assertoric, propositional content to the effect that one is in that very state. The HOT must arise non-inferentially and be roughly contemporaneous with its target. Rosenthal's 2005 monograph "Consciousness and Mind" (Oxford University Press) provides the most complete statement of the theory. A particularly important and controversial aspect of Rosenthal's view is that the qualitative character of conscious experience is determined, at least in part, by the content of the higher-order thought rather than solely by the intrinsic properties of the first-order state. This means that misrepresentation by the HOT can alter what it is like to be in a given state.

**Hakwan Lau** (University of California, Los Angeles; now Riken Center for Brain Science) has been the leading figure in translating HOT theory into empirically testable neuroscience. Lau and Passingham (2006) published a landmark study in PNAS demonstrating that TMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) could reduce subjective awareness while preserving objective discrimination performance, providing direct evidence for prefrontal involvement in generating higher-order representations. Lau's "Perceptual Reality Monitoring" (PRM) theory, fully developed in his 2022 monograph "In Consciousness We Trust" (Oxford University Press), reinterprets HOT in terms of signal detection theory and Bayesian inference. On PRM, consciousness involves a metacognitive monitoring system that classifies neural signals as either "real percepts" or "noise" using a signal detection criterion. The distinction between Type 1 (perceptual) and Type 2 (metacognitive) sensitivity, formalized through the meta-d' measure developed by Maniscalco and Lau (2012), has become a standard tool in consciousness research.

**Richard Brown** (LaGuardia Community College, CUNY) developed the "Radical" version of HOT theory, which holds that the qualitative character of conscious experience is entirely determined by the higher-order representation. Brown and Lau developed the HOROR (Higher-Order Representation Of a Representation) theory (2015), connecting HOT to neural oscillation research and proposing that consciousness involves higher-order representations of first-order sensory representations. Brown, Lau, and LeDoux published an influential 2019 paper in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, "Understanding the Higher-Order Approach to Consciousness," which reinterpreted emotional consciousness through the HOT lens, arguing that the conscious experience of fear requires higher-order cortical representation rather than mere amygdala activation.

**Joseph LeDoux** (New York University) collaborated with Brown and Lau to apply HOT theory to emotional consciousness. LeDoux and Brown (2017) published "A higher-order theory of emotional consciousness" in PNAS, arguing that subcortical circuits (such as the amygdala fear circuit) produce unconscious defensive responses, and that the subjective feeling of fear requires higher-order representation in prefrontal cortex. This reinterpretation challenged decades of emotion neuroscience that attributed conscious emotional experience to subcortical circuits.

**Peter Carruthers** (University of Maryland) developed a dispositional variant of HOT theory. In "Phenomenal Consciousness: A Naturalistic Theory" (2000, Cambridge University Press), Carruthers argued that a state is conscious not because it is actually targeted by a higher-order thought but because it is available to the self-monitoring mechanisms that would generate such thoughts. His "Interpretive Sensory Access" (ISA) theory, developed in "The Opacity of Mind" (2011, Oxford University Press), proposes that introspection operates through the theory-of-mind system turned inward, making self-knowledge interpretive and fallible rather than privileged.

**William Lycan** (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) developed Higher-Order Perception (HOP) theory as an alternative to Rosenthal's thought-based account. In "Consciousness" (1987) and "Consciousness and Experience" (1996, MIT Press), Lycan argued that consciousness involves an "inner sense" -- a quasi-perceptual monitoring mechanism analogous to external perception -- rather than conceptual thought. HOP avoids the objection that animals and infants without conceptual capacities cannot be conscious, since inner perception does not require concepts.

**Uriah Kriegel** (Rice University) developed Self-Representationalism, a variant in which conscious states represent themselves rather than being represented by a separate higher-order state. In "Subjective Consciousness: A Self-Representational Theory" (2009, Oxford University Press), Kriegel argued that conscious states have a complex internal structure with both a world-directed component and a self-directed component unified within a single state, avoiding the regress problem that arises when the higher-order state is separate from its target.

**Stephen Fleming** (University College London) contributed crucial neuroanatomical evidence, demonstrating (Fleming et al., 2010, Science) that gray matter volume in anterior prefrontal cortex predicts individual differences in metacognitive accuracy, providing structural neuroanatomical support for the role of prefrontal cortex in higher-order representation.

### 1.2 Major Discoveries

Lau and Passingham's 2006 PNAS study demonstrated that TMS to the dlPFC reduces subjective awareness (measured by confidence ratings) while preserving objective performance (measured by d-prime), providing the first direct causal evidence for prefrontal involvement in conscious awareness as distinct from perceptual processing.

Fleming et al. (2010) discovered in a study published in Science that the volume of gray matter in the anterior prefrontal cortex predicts individual differences in metacognitive accuracy, establishing a structural brain basis for higher-order representations.

Maniscalco and Lau (2012) developed the meta-d' measure, which quantifies metacognitive efficiency as the ratio of metacognitive sensitivity to perceptual sensitivity. This measure has become the standard tool for studying higher-order representations in consciousness research, enabling precise quantification of the "Type 2" processing that HOT theory identifies with consciousness.

Odegaard, Knight, and Lau (2017) showed that patients with prefrontal cortex damage have impaired metacognitive sensitivity (Type 2 d-prime) while preserving perceptual sensitivity (Type 1 d-prime), directly supporting the dissociation between first-order processing and higher-order awareness predicted by HOT theory.

The Cogitate Consortium adversarial collaboration (2023) tested divergent predictions of GNW (which shares prefrontal emphasis with HOT) and IIT regarding the neural correlates of consciousness, with mixed results that continue to fuel debate about the role of prefrontal cortex in conscious experience.

### 1.3 Current Debates

The anterior-posterior debate about the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) remains the most active controversy relevant to HOT theory. Koch, Massimini, Boly, and Tononi (2016) argued in Nature Reviews Neuroscience that the NCC reside in a posterior cortical "hot zone" rather than in prefrontal cortex, challenging HOT's emphasis on prefrontal processing. Lau (2022) responded by distinguishing "NCC of content" (what you are conscious of, associated with posterior cortex) from "NCC of consciousness level" (the level of awareness, associated with prefrontal monitoring), arguing that both are genuine NCCs but address different aspects of consciousness.

The sufficiency debate concerns whether higher-order representations are sufficient for consciousness or merely necessary. Block (2011) argued in "The Higher Order Approach to Consciousness Is Defunct" that HOT theory faces insurmountable problems including targetless HOTs and the misrepresentation problem. Rosenthal and Brown have countered that targetless HOTs are analogous to hallucinations and that misrepresentation between HOT and first-order state is both theoretically coherent and clinically observable.

The animal consciousness debate remains ongoing. If consciousness requires higher-order thought in Rosenthal's conceptual sense, then many animals may lack consciousness entirely. Lycan's HOP and Carruthers' dispositional approach offer less restrictive alternatives, but the question of how much meta-cognitive capacity is required for consciousness remains unresolved.

## 2. Key Research Areas

### 2.1 Metacognitive Neuroscience

The neuroscience of metacognition provides the primary empirical testing ground for HOT theory. Fleming and Dolan (2012) reviewed the neural substrates of metacognition, identifying the anterior prefrontal cortex (particularly area 10), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex as key regions supporting metacognitive judgments. Functional neuroimaging studies consistently show that these regions are more active during metacognitive evaluations than during first-order perceptual decisions. Neuropsychological studies of patients with prefrontal damage reveal selective metacognitive deficits: patients can perform perceptual tasks at normal levels but show impaired confidence calibration and reduced metacognitive sensitivity (Flemming et al., 2014; Odegaard et al., 2017).

### 2.2 Signal Detection Theory Approaches

Lau's PRM theory translates HOT into the formal language of signal detection theory (SDT). In SDT, a perceptual decision involves comparing a noisy internal signal against a criterion. Lau's innovation was to apply SDT at the metacognitive level: the monitoring system compares internal neural activity against a "reality criterion" to determine whether that activity represents a genuine percept. Type 1 d-prime measures the sensitivity of first-order perceptual processing; Type 2 d-prime (or meta-d') measures the sensitivity of metacognitive monitoring. The finding that these can be dissociated -- that metacognitive sensitivity can vary independently of perceptual sensitivity -- provides strong support for the existence of a higher-order monitoring system distinct from first-order processing.

### 2.3 Prefrontal Cortex and Consciousness

The role of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness is central to HOT theory and remains contentious. Evidence supporting prefrontal involvement includes: (1) TMS studies showing that disrupting dlPFC reduces subjective awareness (Lau & Passingham, 2006; Rounis et al., 2010); (2) structural imaging showing that prefrontal gray matter predicts metacognitive accuracy (Fleming et al., 2010); (3) lesion studies showing metacognitive deficits after prefrontal damage (Fleming et al., 2014; Odegaard et al., 2017); (4) single-unit recordings showing that prefrontal neurons track perceived rather than presented stimuli during binocular rivalry (Panagiotaropoulos et al., 2012). Evidence challenging prefrontal necessity includes reports of preserved consciousness after extensive prefrontal damage and the observation that posterior cortical lesions can produce specific phenomenal deficits (blindness, agnosia) while prefrontal lesions typically do not.

### 2.4 Emotional Consciousness

The application of HOT theory to emotion, led by LeDoux and Brown, has generated a significant research program. LeDoux's 2015 book "Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Fear and Anxiety" and the LeDoux and Brown (2017) PNAS paper argue that traditional emotion neuroscience conflated unconscious defensive responses (mediated by subcortical circuits like the amygdala) with conscious emotional feelings (requiring higher-order cortical representation). On this view, a rat with an activated amygdala is not "afraid" in the conscious, subjective sense -- it is executing a defensive behavior program. Conscious fear requires the addition of a higher-order representation that represents the organism as being in a fearful state. This reinterpretation has profound implications for understanding and treating anxiety disorders.

## 3. Major Theories and Models

### 3.1 Rosenthal's Classical HOT Theory

Rosenthal's theory specifies four conditions for a higher-order thought to make a first-order state conscious: (1) the HOT must have assertoric, propositional content ("I am seeing red"); (2) it must arise non-inferentially (not through reasoning); (3) it must be roughly contemporaneous with its target; and (4) it must represent the subject as being in the target state. The HOT itself need not be conscious -- it typically operates at the dispositional level, requiring a yet-higher-order thought to itself become conscious (yielding "introspective consciousness" as a three-level hierarchy). The qualitative character of experience is determined by the HOT's content through Rosenthal's "quality space" theory, which defines phenomenal qualities as positions in abstract similarity spaces.

### 3.2 Lau's Perceptual Reality Monitoring Theory

Lau's PRM theory recasts HOT in computational terms. The brain continuously monitors its own perceptual processes using a Bayesian signal detection framework. The monitoring system maintains a criterion for classifying internal signals as "real percepts" versus "noise." When a signal exceeds this criterion, the corresponding content becomes conscious. The criterion is not fixed but is dynamically adjusted based on prior expectations, attention, and context. PRM explains key phenomena including blindsight (the monitoring system classifies blind-field signals as "noise"), hallucinations (the criterion is lowered, causing noise to be classified as signal), and the effects of attention on consciousness (attention increases the precision of the monitoring signal).

### 3.3 Carruthers' Dispositional HOT / ISA Theory

Carruthers' theory avoids the requirement for an actual higher-order thought by replacing it with a dispositional condition: a state is conscious if the system is disposed to form a higher-order representation of it. The ISA (Interpretive Sensory Access) version proposes that introspection operates through the mindreading (theory-of-mind) system, which evolved for understanding others and is secondarily turned inward for self-monitoring. This implies that introspection is interpretive and fallible, not a privileged direct access to mental states -- a prediction supported by extensive experimental evidence on the unreliability of introspective reports.

### 3.4 Kriegel's Self-Representationalism

Kriegel's theory solves the regress problem by locating the higher-order component within the conscious state itself rather than in a separate mental state. Each conscious state has a complex structure: a "core" directed at the world (first-order content) and a "periphery" directed at the state itself (higher-order content). These are unified within a single mental event, making the state "self-representing." This avoids the need for a separate higher-order state and the associated question of whether that state must itself be conscious.

## 4. Experimental Paradigms

### 4.1 TMS Studies of Prefrontal Involvement

Transcranial magnetic stimulation of prefrontal cortex has been a key method for testing HOT predictions. Lau and Passingham (2006) applied TMS to dlPFC during a metacontrast masking task, showing reduced subjective visibility without impaired discrimination. Rounis et al. (2010) replicated and extended this finding, showing that TMS to dlPFC reduces metacognitive sensitivity (Type 2 d-prime) while preserving perceptual sensitivity (Type 1 d-prime). These results directly support the dissociation between first-order processing and higher-order monitoring that HOT theory predicts.

### 4.2 Blindsight Studies

Blindsight -- the ability to respond to visual stimuli in a blind field without conscious awareness -- is a paradigmatic case for HOT theory. Patients with V1 damage can discriminate stimuli presented in their blind field when forced to guess, but report no conscious experience. HOT interprets blindsight as intact first-order visual processing (supporting discrimination) without higher-order representation (explaining absent awareness). Lau (2022) reinterprets blindsight through PRM: the metacognitive monitoring system classifies blind-field signals as "noise" because the damaged pathway produces signals that do not match the monitoring system's template for "real" visual percepts.

### 4.3 Metacognitive Sensitivity Paradigms

The development of meta-d' (Maniscalco & Lau, 2012) enabled precise measurement of metacognitive sensitivity. In a typical paradigm, subjects make a perceptual discrimination (e.g., which interval contained a Gabor patch?) followed by a confidence judgment. Type 1 d-prime measures perceptual sensitivity; meta-d' measures how well confidence tracks accuracy. The ratio meta-d'/d-prime ("metacognitive efficiency") quantifies the quality of higher-order monitoring. Studies using this paradigm have shown that metacognitive efficiency varies across individuals, correlates with prefrontal cortex structure and function, is impaired by prefrontal damage and TMS, and is modulated by attention and arousal -- all consistent with HOT predictions.

### 4.4 Confidence and Consciousness Dissociation

Several paradigms dissociate confidence (a higher-order judgment) from first-order performance. Lau and Passingham (2006) showed that TMS to dlPFC reduces confidence without affecting accuracy. Rahnev et al. (2011) showed that attention can increase confidence without improving accuracy. These dissociations support HOT's claim that consciousness (tracked by confidence) depends on higher-order processes that are distinct from, and can be manipulated independently of, first-order perceptual processing.

### 4.5 Adversarial Collaboration Testing

The Templeton Foundation adversarial collaboration tested predictions of IIT (consciousness requires posterior cortical activation) against GNW (consciousness requires frontoparietal ignition). While this collaboration does not directly test HOT, HOT's predictions align with GNW's in emphasizing prefrontal involvement. Initial results (Cogitate Consortium, 2023) found evidence for both sustained posterior activation (supporting IIT) and late frontoparietal signals (supporting GNW/HOT) during conscious perception, leaving the debate open.

## 5. Philosophical Implications

### 5.1 The Nature of Phenomenal Character

HOT theory, particularly in its "radical" version developed by Brown, implies that the qualitative character of conscious experience is not an intrinsic property of first-order sensory states but is determined by higher-order representation. This means that if the higher-order thought misrepresents the first-order state (e.g., representing green as red), the subject's conscious experience is of red, not green. This consequence is embraced by radical HOT theorists as explaining certain perceptual illusions and distortions, but is rejected by opponents as counterintuitive and potentially unfalsifiable.

### 5.2 Consciousness Without Self-Consciousness

HOT theory carefully distinguishes consciousness of a mental state from self-consciousness in the full reflective sense. The higher-order thought need not itself be conscious; it operates as a background enabling condition. One need not explicitly think "I am seeing red" to consciously see red; one must merely be disposed to have such a thought. This distinction allows HOT to account for unreflective, "absorbed" experience while maintaining that consciousness requires higher-order representation.

### 5.3 The Limits of Introspection

Carruthers' ISA theory and the broader HOT tradition have significant implications for the reliability of introspection. If self-knowledge is mediated by interpretive mechanisms rather than direct access, introspective reports are fallible and potentially systematically biased. Schwitzgebel (2008, "The Unreliability of Naive Introspection") marshaled extensive empirical evidence for introspective failure, supporting the HOT view that introspection is a constructive process rather than a transparent window into the mind.

### 5.4 Machine Consciousness

HOT theory provides relatively clear criteria for artificial consciousness: a system is conscious if it has both first-order processing and a higher-order monitoring system that represents the system as being in particular processing states. This two-level architecture is, in principle, implementable in artificial systems. Lau (2022) discussed how generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an analogy for PRM: the "discriminator" network classifies internal representations as "real" or "generated," functioning analogously to the metacognitive monitoring system that HOT requires for consciousness.

## 6. Cross-Form Connections

### 6.1 Connection to Form 13 (Integrated Information Theory)

HOT and IIT offer contrasting accounts of consciousness. IIT locates consciousness in the intrinsic causal structure of a system (measured by Phi) and is agnostic about higher-order representation. HOT locates consciousness in the presence of appropriate higher-order representations and is agnostic about causal structure per se. The two theories can potentially be integrated: systems with high Phi may be more likely to generate higher-order representations (because their integrated causal structure supports the necessary meta-cognitive loops), and higher-order representation may increase Phi (by adding recursive connections that resist decomposition). The empirical debate centers on the posterior vs. anterior NCC question: IIT predicts posterior cortical substrates; HOT predicts prefrontal involvement.

### 6.2 Connection to Form 14 (Global Workspace Theory)

HOT and GWT are naturally complementary. GWT explains how information becomes globally accessible; HOT explains how globally accessed information becomes consciously experienced. In a combined framework, global broadcasting provides the mechanism that triggers higher-order representations: when sensory content enters the global workspace, it becomes available to prefrontal monitoring systems that generate the HOTs conferring consciousness. Lau and Rosenthal (2011) explicitly proposed this integration in their Trends in Cognitive Sciences paper, arguing that GWT provides the access mechanism while HOT provides the phenomenal mechanism.

### 6.3 Connection to Form 16 (Predictive Coding)

Predictive processing frameworks provide a natural computational implementation of HOT. Higher-order representations can be understood as predictions about one's own mental states, and the accuracy of these predictions (metacognitive sensitivity) determines the quality of conscious experience. Lau's PRM theory explicitly uses Bayesian predictive processing: the monitoring system generates predictions about what "real" percepts should look like and classifies incoming signals accordingly. Precision weighting of higher-order predictions determines the vividness and clarity of conscious experience: high-precision higher-order predictions yield vivid, clear consciousness; low-precision predictions yield fuzzy, uncertain awareness.

### 6.4 Connection to Form 17 (Recurrent Processing)

Recurrent processing provides the temporal substrate for generating higher-order representations. Lamme's (2006) distinction between feedforward and recurrent processing maps onto HOT's distinction between unconscious first-order processing and conscious higher-order representation. The transition from feedforward to recurrent processing (~150-200ms post-stimulus) corresponds to the time at which higher-order monitoring becomes possible. Global recurrent processing (involving prefrontal feedback loops) provides the neural mechanism for generating the higher-order representations that HOT requires. The debate between local recurrence (Lamme's "phenomenal consciousness without access") and global recurrence (corresponding to HOT-mediated conscious access) parallels the broader debate about whether consciousness requires higher-order representation.

### 6.5 Connection to Form 18 (Primary Consciousness)

HOT theory distinguishes primary consciousness from higher-order consciousness. Primary consciousness, in HOT terms, arises from relatively simple, non-conceptual higher-order monitoring -- a basic capacity to represent oneself as being in perceptual states without full reflective self-awareness. This is consistent with Edelman's (1989) distinction between primary consciousness (present in many animals, involving perception and emotion but not self-reflection) and higher-order consciousness (present in humans and perhaps great apes, involving language-mediated self-reflection). On HOT, even primary consciousness requires some form of higher-order representation, but this representation can be non-conceptual (as in Lycan's HOP) or dispositional (as in Carruthers' account), allowing for consciousness in organisms without full conceptual or linguistic capacities.
