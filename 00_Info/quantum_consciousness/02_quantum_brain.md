# Quantum Brain Theories

## Quantum Field Theory, Interactive Dualism, Posner Molecules, and the Implicate Order

Beyond Orch-OR, several other serious proposals exist for the role of quantum mechanics in brain function and consciousness. These theories differ significantly in their physical mechanisms, philosophical commitments, and empirical implications. This document covers four major programs: Quantum Brain Dynamics, Stapp's quantum interactive dualism, Fisher's quantum cognition hypothesis, and Bohm's implicate order. It concludes by examining the connections between these quantum theories and non-dual philosophy.

## Part I: Quantum Brain Dynamics (Umezawa, Jibu & Yasue, Vitiello)

### Origins in Quantum Field Theory

Quantum Brain Dynamics (QBD) applies quantum field theory (QFT) -- the mathematical framework underlying particle physics -- to the neural system. Unlike Orch-OR, which focuses on quantum gravity and individual protein molecules, QBD describes collective quantum phenomena at the macroscopic scale. The key insight of QBD is that ordered quantum states can exist in many-body systems even at biological temperatures, just as they do in superconductors, superfluids, and laser systems.

### Umezawa's Quantum Neurodynamics

Hiroomi Umezawa, a Japanese-Canadian theoretical physicist known for his contributions to quantum field theory, proposed in the 1960s-1970s that the brain operates as a quantum field system. His central idea was that memory storage and recall involve quantum vacuum states (ground states) of neural fields.

In QFT, the vacuum state is not empty but is the state of lowest energy, characterized by specific symmetry properties. Different vacuum states correspond to different patterns of symmetry breaking. Umezawa proposed that different memories correspond to different vacuum states of the brain's quantum fields. Memory recording is a process of symmetry breaking that creates a new vacuum state; memory recall involves excitation from one vacuum state to another.

The mathematical framework uses Nambu-Goldstone bosons -- massless quanta that appear whenever a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken. In condensed matter physics, phonons (in crystals), magnons (in ferromagnets), and the photon-like quanta in superconductors are all Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Umezawa proposed that Nambu-Goldstone bosons in the brain -- which he and his colleagues called "corticons" (quanta of cortical fields) and "symmetrons" (quanta that mediate symmetry breaking) -- carry the coherent quantum information that constitutes memory and cognition.

### Jibu and Yasue's Quantum Brain Dynamics

Mari Jibu and Kunio Yasue, working in the 1990s, developed Umezawa's ideas into a more complete theory. They focused specifically on the electric dipole fields of water molecules in neural tissue. The brain is approximately 80% water by volume, and these water molecules are not randomly oriented but form ordered structures, particularly in the thin layers surrounding microtubules, cell membranes, and within the interior of axons and dendrites.

Jibu and Yasue proposed that:

1. **Ordered water dipole fields**: Water molecules in neural tissue can form coherent quantum states through the ordering of their electric dipole moments. These ordered domains act as quantum field systems.

2. **Evanescent photons**: Quantum coherence is mediated by evanescent (non-propagating) photons exchanged between water molecules. These photons exist within the coherent domain and do not dissipate into the environment.

3. **Quantum tunneling through ordered water**: The ordered water channels within and around microtubules can support quantum tunneling of photons, enabling coherent information transfer at speeds and scales that classical electrochemical signaling cannot achieve.

4. **Consciousness as coherent photon field**: Conscious experience corresponds to the coherent state of the cortical quantum field -- the macroscopic quantum state of the brain's water-dipole-photon system.

### Vitiello's Dissipative Quantum Model

Giuseppe Vitiello, an Italian theoretical physicist, introduced what may be the most mathematically sophisticated quantum brain model. His key innovation was to recognize that the brain is an *open, dissipative system* -- it constantly exchanges energy and information with its environment -- and that the formalism of quantum field theory must be extended to account for this.

In standard QFT, the system and its environment are treated as a single closed system. Vitiello used the "doubled Hilbert space" formalism of thermo field dynamics (TFD), developed by Umezawa and Takahashi, in which the system is formally doubled: one copy represents the system itself, and the other represents the thermal environment.

This doubling has a remarkable consequence for consciousness theory. Vitiello proposed that:

1. **The doubled system**: The brain (system A) is formally doubled with its environment (system tilde-A). The two copies are entangled through thermal interactions.

2. **Memory as entangled vacuum states**: Memories are encoded not in single vacuum states (as Umezawa proposed) but in entangled states of the system-environment pair. This resolves a problem with Umezawa's original model -- the "overprinting problem" -- where new memories would overwrite old ones. In Vitiello's model, the infinite degrees of freedom of the environment provide unlimited memory capacity.

3. **Consciousness as self-referential**: The relationship between the system and its doubled copy creates an intrinsic self-referential structure. The brain (A) "sees" its own image reflected in the environment (tilde-A), creating a natural basis for self-awareness without requiring a homunculus.

4. **Time and irreversibility**: The dissipative character of the system introduces irreversibility -- the arrow of time -- into the quantum description. This connects the quantum model to the phenomenological experience of time's passage, which is absent from the time-reversible equations of standard quantum mechanics.

5. **Coherent states and the classical limit**: Vitiello showed that the coherent states of the quantum brain model correspond, in the classical limit, to the classical neural field patterns described by standard neuroscience. The quantum model does not contradict classical neuroscience but provides a deeper substrate from which classical neural dynamics emerge.

### Assessment of QBD

Quantum Brain Dynamics has the advantage of being formulated in the well-established mathematical framework of quantum field theory. It does not require exotic physics (quantum gravity, Objective Reduction) and it connects naturally to condensed matter physics, where macroscopic quantum phenomena are well understood.

However, the key empirical question remains: do coherent quantum field states actually exist in neural tissue? The ordered water hypothesis has some support from studies of biological water (the work of Gerald Pollack on "exclusion zone" water, and NMR studies of intracellular water), but direct evidence for macroscopic quantum coherence in the brain is lacking. The theory makes predictions about coherent photon emissions from neural tissue that could, in principle, be tested.

## Part II: Stapp's Quantum Interactive Dualism

### The Framework

Henry Stapp, a theoretical physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who worked with Heisenberg and contributed to the development of S-matrix theory, has developed over several decades a theory in which quantum mechanics provides the physical basis for consciousness and free will. Unlike Orch-OR and QBD, Stapp's theory operates entirely within standard (orthodox, von Neumann-Dirac) quantum mechanics without requiring new physics.

### Process 1 and Process 2

Stapp's framework rests on the standard quantum mechanical distinction between two types of processes:

**Process 2 (Unitary evolution)**: The deterministic evolution of the quantum state according to the Schrodinger equation. This process is continuous, reversible, and does not involve consciousness. It describes the physical world evolving according to the laws of physics when no observation or choice is being made.

**Process 1 (Probing action / measurement)**: The non-deterministic selection of a particular observable to measure -- the "question posed to nature." In orthodox quantum mechanics, Process 1 is where the observer enters the picture. The choice of what to measure determines which observable the system is projected onto, and the outcome is probabilistic.

Stapp's key insight is that **Process 1 is a free choice**. It is not determined by the prior physical state of the system. In standard quantum mechanics, what to measure is determined by the experimenter, and the theory is silent about what determines the experimenter's choice. Stapp identifies this freedom with conscious volition -- the capacity of mind to direct attention and thereby select what question is posed to the brain's quantum state.

### The Quantum Zeno Effect and Attention

The mechanism by which consciousness exerts its influence, in Stapp's model, is the quantum Zeno effect (also called the watched pot effect). In quantum mechanics, rapid repeated measurement of a system can freeze its evolution -- the system is held in its current state by the act of observation. Stapp proposes that:

1. The brain evolves according to Process 2 (Schrodinger equation) into a superposition of possible neural states.
2. Consciousness intervenes through Process 1 to "query" the brain, selecting a particular template of neural activity.
3. Rapid repetition of this query -- sustained attention -- exploits the quantum Zeno effect to hold the selected neural pattern in place, preventing the brain from evolving away from it.
4. This is the physical mechanism of effortful attention, will, and mental causation.

Empirically, Stapp points to the work of Jeffrey Schwartz on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Schwartz developed a cognitive-behavioral therapy in which patients learn to redirect their attention away from obsessive thoughts. fMRI studies showed that sustained voluntary attention physically changed neural activity patterns in the orbital frontal cortex and caudate nucleus. Stapp and Schwartz (along with Mario Beauregard) have co-authored papers arguing that this is evidence for mental causation through the quantum Zeno effect.

### Philosophical Position

Stapp calls his position "interactive dualism" -- but it is not substance dualism in the Cartesian sense. Mind and matter are not separate substances; rather, mind (Process 1) and matter (Process 2) are two aspects of a single quantum process, as described by the orthodox quantum formalism. Stapp draws heavily on the philosophy of William James (radical empiricism, the "stream of consciousness") and Alfred North Whitehead (process philosophy, actual occasions of experience).

In Stapp's view:
- Consciousness is not produced by the brain.
- The brain provides the quantum mechanical options (the superposition of possible states).
- Consciousness selects among these options through Process 1.
- The outcome of the selection is partially free (not determined by prior physics) and partially constrained (by the quantum probabilities).
- This provides a natural account of free will that is neither deterministic nor random.

### Criticisms

Stapp's theory has been criticized on several grounds:

1. **The measurement problem remains**: Stapp places consciousness at the measurement/observation boundary, but this does not explain consciousness so much as relocate it. Why should Process 1 be accompanied by subjective experience?

2. **Circularity concern**: If consciousness is needed to collapse quantum states, but the brain that supports consciousness is itself a quantum system requiring collapse, the account appears circular.

3. **Empirical specificity**: The theory does not make specific quantitative predictions that distinguish it from classical accounts of attention and neural plasticity.

4. **Scale of quantum effects**: It is unclear whether quantum superpositions of functionally distinct neural states actually exist at the relevant scale before "measurement" by consciousness.

Despite these criticisms, Stapp's framework has the virtue of working within established quantum mechanics and connecting consciousness to the genuine foundational puzzle of quantum measurement.

## Part III: Fisher's Quantum Cognition Hypothesis

### Posner Molecules as Neural Qubits

Matthew Fisher, a condensed matter physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara (and winner of the 2015 Oliver Buckley Prize), proposed in a 2015 paper in *Annals of Physics* a remarkably specific mechanism for quantum processing in the brain. Unlike previous proposals, Fisher's hypothesis is grounded in well-established nuclear physics and chemistry, and it identifies a specific molecular system that could maintain quantum coherence for biologically relevant timescales.

### The Mechanism

Fisher's proposal centers on phosphorus nuclear spins in biological systems:

**Step 1: Phosphorus nuclear spin as qubit**
The phosphorus-31 nucleus has a nuclear spin of 1/2, making it a natural qubit. Nuclear spins are exceptionally well shielded from environmental decoherence because they interact very weakly with electric fields (which dominate the biological environment). Nuclear spin coherence times in biological molecules can extend to seconds, minutes, or even hours -- vastly longer than the femtosecond (10^-13 s) decoherence times calculated by Tegmark for electronic and ionic superpositions.

**Step 2: Posner molecules (Ca9(PO4)6)**
Posner molecules are calcium phosphate clusters, Ca9(PO4)6, that form naturally in biological fluids including blood, bone, and extracellular fluid in the brain. Each Posner molecule contains six phosphorus atoms. Fisher proposes that the nuclear spins of these six phosphorus atoms become entangled within the Posner molecule, creating a multi-qubit quantum state.

**Step 3: Entanglement through enzyme action**
The enzyme pyrophosphatase breaks diphosphate molecules (containing two phosphorus atoms) into two individual phosphate ions. Fisher argues that this process can create entangled pairs of phosphorus nuclear spins -- the two phosphate ions emerging from the enzymatic reaction remain quantum entangled even after they separate and are incorporated into different Posner molecules.

**Step 4: Posner molecules in synaptic signaling**
Posner molecules can be taken up by neurons through endocytosis. Inside the neuron, they can be transported to presynaptic terminals. When Posner molecules from different neurons -- containing entangled phosphorus spins -- arrive at the same synapse, their quantum states interact. The chemical binding and dissolution of Posner molecules could release entangled phosphate ions that influence calcium signaling, glutamate release, and other synaptic processes.

**Step 5: Quantum-influenced neural correlations**
If synaptic transmission is modulated by quantum entanglement between phosphorus nuclear spins in different Posner molecules, the result would be non-classical correlations in neural firing patterns -- correlations that cannot be explained by any classical mechanism.

### The Lithium Connection

Fisher's hypothesis makes a striking testable prediction involving lithium. Lithium is the most effective medication for bipolar disorder, yet its mechanism of action is poorly understood despite decades of clinical use.

Lithium has two stable isotopes: lithium-6 (spin-1, 7.5% natural abundance) and lithium-7 (spin-3/2, 92.5% natural abundance). Fisher argues that these isotopes interact differently with phosphorus nuclear spins:

- Lithium-6, with its integer spin, would weakly entangle with phosphorus spins, *preserving* quantum coherence in Posner molecules.
- Lithium-7, with its half-integer spin, would more strongly entangle with phosphorus spins, *disrupting* quantum coherence.

If Fisher is right, lithium-6 and lithium-7 should have different effects on behavior. Remarkably, a 1986 study by Sechzer et al. found that rats given lithium-6 showed significantly different behavior (reduced maternal behavior) compared to rats given lithium-7. This isotope-dependent behavioral effect is difficult to explain by any classical biochemical mechanism, since the two isotopes are chemically identical.

Fisher has proposed new experiments using isotopically enriched lithium to test this prediction more rigorously.

### Assessment

Fisher's hypothesis has several notable strengths:

1. **Physical plausibility**: Nuclear spin coherence times are genuinely long in biological molecules. This avoids the decoherence objection that plagues other quantum brain theories.
2. **Specificity**: The theory identifies a specific molecular system (Posner molecules), a specific qubit (phosphorus nuclear spin), and a specific coupling mechanism (enzymatic entanglement).
3. **Testable predictions**: The lithium isotope effect is a specific, testable prediction.
4. **Credentials**: Fisher is a leading condensed matter physicist, and his proposal has been taken seriously by the physics community.

The main uncertainties are whether Posner molecules actually form and persist in the brain in sufficient quantities, whether the entanglement mechanism actually operates as proposed, and whether the resulting quantum effects are large enough to influence neural function at a behaviorally relevant scale.

## Part IV: Bohm's Implicate Order

### Background

David Bohm (1917-1992) was one of the most original and philosophically minded physicists of the twentieth century. A student of J. Robert Oppenheimer, he made important contributions to plasma physics, quantum theory, and the foundations of physics. His 1952 "pilot wave" interpretation of quantum mechanics (building on earlier work by de Broglie) demonstrated that a deterministic, non-local interpretation of quantum mechanics is possible, challenging the Copenhagen orthodoxy that had dominated since the 1920s.

Bohm's later work moved beyond technical physics into a comprehensive philosophical vision in which quantum mechanics reveals fundamental truths about the nature of reality, consciousness, and meaning.

### Pilot Wave Theory

In Bohm's pilot wave (or "causal") interpretation of quantum mechanics:

- Particles have definite positions at all times (unlike in the Copenhagen interpretation, where position is undefined until measured).
- The wave function is a real physical field -- the "pilot wave" or "quantum potential" -- that guides the motion of particles.
- The quantum potential is non-local: it depends on the configuration of the entire system, not just on local conditions. A change in one part of the system instantaneously affects the quantum potential everywhere.
- Measurement results are determined by the actual positions of particles, which are generally unknown (hence the statistical character of quantum predictions).

The pilot wave interpretation is empirically equivalent to standard quantum mechanics -- it makes all the same predictions. But its ontology is radically different: reality consists of particles guided by a non-local information field.

### The Implicate Order

In *Wholeness and the Implicate Order* (1980) and subsequent works, Bohm generalized the insights of quantum mechanics into a comprehensive metaphysical framework:

**Explicate order**: The manifest, unfolded world of distinct objects, events, and processes as we ordinarily experience them. This is the order described by classical physics and common sense -- a world of separate things interacting locally.

**Implicate order**: A deeper, enfolded reality in which everything is enfolded into everything else. The implicate order is the ground from which the explicate order emerges. Just as a hologram encodes a three-dimensional image in a two-dimensional pattern of interference fringes (so that every part of the hologram contains information about the whole image), the implicate order enfolds the totality of existence in each region of space-time.

**Holomovement**: Reality is not a collection of static objects but a dynamic, flowing movement -- the "holomovement" -- in which implicate and explicate orders continuously unfold and enfold. This movement is primary; objects and events are secondary, being relatively stable patterns abstracted from the underlying flow.

### Consciousness and the Implicate Order

Bohm's treatment of consciousness follows naturally from the implicate order framework:

1. **Consciousness is not separate from matter**: In the implicate order, mind and matter are not two distinct substances but two aspects of a single deeper reality. Thought is a relatively subtle and interior movement of the implicate order; matter is a relatively gross and exterior movement. But both are movements of the same underlying wholeness.

2. **Soma-significance**: Bohm introduced the concept of "soma-significance" to describe the relationship between physical form (soma) and meaning (significance). In the implicate order, meaning is not imposed on matter by an external mind; it is intrinsic to the structure of reality. A cell, an organism, a thought -- each has a somatic (physical) aspect and a significant (meaningful) aspect, and these are inseparable.

3. **The explicate order as manifest experience**: Our ordinary conscious experience -- the world of distinct objects, spatial separations, and temporal sequences -- corresponds to the explicate order. It is a *kind of appearance*, a particular way in which the implicate order manifests.

4. **The implicate order as the non-dual ground**: The implicate order, in which everything is enfolded into everything else, is structurally identical to what non-dual philosophies describe as the ground of being: an undivided wholeness from which all apparent multiplicity arises.

5. **Thought as fragmentation**: Bohm argued extensively that thought itself is the source of fragmentation -- the process by which the undivided whole is broken into apparently separate parts. The content of thought creates the illusion of a separate self confronting a separate world. This is precisely the central claim of non-dual philosophy.

### The Bohm-Krishnamurti Dialogues

From 1961 until Krishnamurti's death in 1986, Bohm and J. Krishnamurti conducted a remarkable series of dialogues exploring the relationship between Bohm's physics and Krishnamurti's non-dual teaching. These dialogues, documented in *The Ending of Time* (1985), *The Future of Humanity* (1986), and *The Limits of Thought* (1999), represent one of the most sustained and serious conversations between a major physicist and a major contemplative teacher in modern history.

Key themes of the dialogues:

- **Thought as the source of division**: Both Bohm and Krishnamurti agreed that thought, by its very nature, fragments reality into separate categories and creates the illusion of a separate observer.
- **The ending of thought as revelation of wholeness**: Krishnamurti's teaching that awareness without the movement of thought reveals an undivided reality was, for Bohm, consistent with the implicate order -- the wholeness that underlies all apparent fragmentation.
- **Intelligence beyond thought**: Both explored the possibility of an intelligence that operates not through the known, not through accumulated knowledge and memory, but through direct perception of what is.
- **The nature of time**: Krishnamurti's distinction between chronological time and psychological time (the felt passage created by thought) resonated with Bohm's view that time, in the implicate order, is not fundamental but is an aspect of the explicate order.
- **Matter and consciousness as inseparable**: Bohm's soma-significance converged with Krishnamurti's view that the distinction between the material and the spiritual is itself a product of thought.

### Super-Implicate Orders

In his later work, Bohm proposed a hierarchy of implicate orders:

- The first implicate order gives rise to the explicate order of manifest reality.
- A **super-implicate order** organizes and guides the first implicate order, much as the quantum potential guides particle motion.
- Further levels of implicate order may exist, each more subtle and encompassing.

Bohm suggested that consciousness might be associated with the super-implicate order -- a level of reality that organizes and gives meaning to the physical world without being reducible to it. This is speculative, but it provides a framework in which consciousness is neither an epiphenomenon of matter nor a separate substance, but a fundamental aspect of the multi-leveled structure of reality.

### Assessment of Bohm's Framework

Bohm's implicate order is not a scientific theory in the narrow sense -- it does not make specific quantitative predictions that distinguish it from other interpretations of quantum mechanics. It is better understood as a *metaphysical framework*: a way of thinking about reality that is consistent with quantum mechanics and that provides a natural place for consciousness in the physical world.

Its strengths include:

1. **Physical grounding**: Unlike many philosophical approaches to consciousness, Bohm's framework is grounded in a legitimate interpretation of quantum mechanics (pilot wave theory) that is empirically equivalent to standard quantum mechanics.
2. **Integration of mind and matter**: The implicate order dissolves the mind-body problem not by reducing one to the other but by showing that both are aspects of a deeper reality.
3. **Convergence with non-dual philosophy**: The structural parallels between the implicate order and non-dual contemplative traditions are striking and non-trivial.
4. **Intellectual coherence**: The framework provides a unified account of quantum non-locality, the wholeness of reality, the nature of thought, and the possibility of awareness beyond thought.

Its limitations include:

1. **Empirical underdetermination**: The implicate order does not make predictions beyond those of standard quantum mechanics.
2. **Vagueness at key points**: The relationship between the implicate order and specific neural processes is not specified with enough precision to be testable.
3. **Metaphysical rather than scientific**: The framework is a philosophical vision, not a falsifiable scientific theory.

## Part V: Connections Between Quantum Theories and Non-Dual Philosophy

### Structural Parallels

Several deep structural parallels exist between quantum consciousness theories and non-dual philosophical traditions:

**Wholeness prior to parts**: Bohm's implicate order, Vitiello's entangled vacuum states, and the quantum field approach all describe reality as fundamentally undivided, with separateness being a derivative appearance. This mirrors the non-dual claim that the separation between subject and object, self and world, is an appearance within a deeper unity.

**The observer is not separate from the observed**: In orthodox quantum mechanics (Stapp's framework), the act of observation participates in determining what is observed. In the Copenhagen interpretation, measurement and outcome are inseparable. This resonates with the phenomenological insight that subject and object co-arise, and with the Buddhist teaching of dependent origination.

**Non-locality as interconnectedness**: Quantum entanglement demonstrates that separated systems can maintain correlations that no local mechanism can explain. This is structurally similar to the non-dual intuition that all things are interconnected at a level deeper than spatial separation.

**The role of the observer/awareness**: Stapp's identification of consciousness with Process 1 (the act of observation) places awareness at the foundation of physical reality, not as a byproduct. This parallels the non-dual claim that awareness is primary and the material world arises within it.

### Important Differences

These parallels should not be overstated. There are important disanalogies:

1. **Quantum non-locality is not mystical unity**: Quantum entanglement does not allow faster-than-light signaling and does not imply that "everything is one" in any straightforward sense. The correlations are statistical and cannot be used to transmit information.

2. **Different levels of discourse**: Non-dual philosophy describes the structure of lived experience. Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of physical systems. The mapping between these levels is not straightforward.

3. **Pseudoscience risk**: The genuine parallels have been exploited by popular authors who equate quantum mechanics with mystical consciousness in ways that are neither good physics nor good philosophy. Serious researchers on both sides are careful to distinguish structural analogies from identity claims.

### Where the Connection Is Strongest

The Bohm-Krishnamurti dialogue remains the most intellectually rigorous exploration of the quantum-nondual connection. It succeeds because both participants were operating at the highest level of their respective disciplines and neither was trying to reduce one domain to the other. Bohm was not trying to "prove" Krishnamurti's insights with physics, and Krishnamurti was not trying to acquire scientific credentials for his teaching. They were exploring whether two independent investigations of reality -- one through physics, one through the direct observation of consciousness -- had converged on the same territory.

This question remains open and genuinely important.
