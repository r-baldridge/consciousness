# Form 14: Global Workspace Theory (GWT)

## Definition

Global Workspace Theory implements a limited-capacity broadcasting architecture where specialized processors compete for access to a shared workspace, and winning content is globally broadcast to all modules. Modeled on Baars' theater metaphor, Form 14 serves as the central coordination hub for conscious access, integrating IIT, HOT, and Predictive Coding into a unified consciousness framework with adaptive capacity management.

## Key Concepts

- **Limited-Capacity Broadcasting**: `GlobalWorkspaceCore` with base capacity of 7 items (Miller's number), adaptive range 3-12, and broadcast threshold of 0.7 (ignition point)
- **Competitive Access**: `WorkspaceCompetitionEngine` with six weighted factors -- salience (0.25), attention (0.20), phi_enhancement (0.20), arousal (0.15), novelty (0.10), emotional_valence (0.10)
- **Theater Metaphor**: Stage (limited workspace), Spotlight (attention), Audience (unconscious processors receiving broadcast), Actors (competing content coalitions)
- **Phi-Enhanced Competition**: `PhiEnhancedCompetition` with logarithmic/linear/sigmoid enhancement curves where IIT Phi values boost coalition competitiveness
- **Arousal-Modulated Dynamics**: `ArousalModulatedCompetition` implementing inverted-U for cognitive content and monotonic enhancement for threat-related content
- **Ignition Dynamics**: `GlobalBroadcastingEngine` triggering global broadcast when coalition strength exceeds ignition_threshold (0.7), propagating to all subscribed modules
- **Unified Consciousness Framework**: `UnifiedConsciousnessFramework` chaining arousal_gating -> IIT_integration -> PP_prediction -> GWT_competition -> HOT_higher_order in a 5-stage processing cascade

## Core Methods & Mechanisms

- **Multi-Factor Salience Computation**: `SalienceComputer` combining intensity (0.3), contrast (0.25), motion (0.2), semantic_relevance (0.15), and temporal_novelty (0.1) into composite salience scores
- **Hub-and-Spoke Communication**: Central hub connecting all 26+ modules with frequency-specific integration -- Arousal at 50Hz with consciousness gating at 100Hz, IIT at 20Hz, sensory modules at modality rates (visual 60Hz, auditory 100Hz, tactile 30Hz), cognitive modules at 20Hz, specialized modules at 10Hz
- **Adaptive Capacity Management**: `AdaptiveCapacityManager` dynamically adjusting workspace capacity (base=7, bounds 3-12) based on arousal level, task demands, and cognitive load
- **Attention Control Integration**: `AttentionControlAlgorithm` managing top-down vs. bottom-up attention allocation that modulates competition weights

## Cross-Form Relationships

| Related Form | Relationship | Integration Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Form 13 (IIT) | Phi-guided access | PhiGuidedWorkspace uses Phi values to enhance competition scores; IntegratedBroadcasting ensures broadcast content maximizes integration |
| Form 15 (HOT) | Higher-order workspace | HigherOrderWorkspace adds recursive consciousness (max_depth=3); HOT representations compete for and modulate broadcast content |
| Form 16 (Predictive Coding) | Prediction-error driven | PredictionErrorWorkspace routes high-precision prediction errors into competition; surprising content gets broadcast priority |
| Form 08 (Arousal) | Consciousness gating | 50Hz arousal integration with 100Hz gating; arousal level determines effective workspace capacity and competition dynamics |
| Forms 01-06 (Sensory) | Content sourcing | Modality-specific sensory content enters competition at native frequencies (visual 60Hz, auditory 100Hz, tactile 30Hz, etc.) |
| Forms 07, 09-12 (Cognitive) | Cognitive integration | Higher cognitive content competes at 20Hz; narrative, self-model, and meta-cognitive content participate in workspace dynamics |

## Unique Contributions

Form 14 uniquely provides the central coordination mechanism that makes distributed processing coherent by implementing competitive access to a shared global broadcast. Its unified consciousness framework is the only component that chains IIT, Predictive Coding, GWT competition, and HOT into a single processing cascade, creating the bottleneck that transforms parallel unconscious processing into serial conscious experience.

## Research Highlights

- **Global ignition is all-or-none**: Sergent and Dehaene (2004) demonstrated that conscious access exhibits a sudden, nonlinear ignition pattern -- stimuli either achieve full frontoparietal activation (P3b component) or remain locally processed, with no intermediate states, confirming GNW's threshold prediction
- **Neurochemical modulation of workspace access**: Acetylcholine enhances signal-to-noise ratio, dopamine modulates priority-based access, and noradrenaline (via the Aston-Jones adaptive gain model) switches between focused and exploratory workspace modes, establishing the neurochemical basis for workspace dynamics
- **Clinical diagnostic applications**: King, Sitt, and colleagues (2013) developed EEG-based measures of global workspace complexity that detect consciousness in non-communicating patients, and deep brain stimulation of the central thalamus has temporarily restored consciousness in minimally conscious patients (Schiff et al., 2007)
- **Attention-consciousness dissociation debated**: Tsuchiya and Koch (2007) and van Boxtel et al. (2010) presented evidence that attention and consciousness can be dissociated, challenging GNW's tight coupling of attentional spotlight with conscious access and motivating no-report paradigm development
