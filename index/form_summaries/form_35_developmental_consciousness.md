# Form 35: Developmental Consciousness

## Definition
Form 35 addresses the emergence, transformation, and decline of consciousness across the human lifespan, from prenatal development through end-of-life, integrating developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, neurophenomenology, and death studies.

## Key Concepts
- Ontogenesis of awareness: when and how consciousness first emerges in development
- Developmental stage progression from prenatal through neonatal, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and end-of-life
- Core knowledge systems present in infants (object permanence, physical reasoning)
- Theory of mind emergence and its role in social consciousness (Sally-Anne, Smarties test)
- Metacognition development as higher-order awareness of one's own cognitive processes
- Temporal consciousness and autobiographical memory formation
- Mortality awareness, wisdom integration, and near-death experience research
- Critical periods for therapeutic intervention across the lifespan

## Core Methods & Mechanisms
- Looking time paradigms (habituation, violation of expectation) for pre-verbal infant cognition
- EEG/ERP and fNIRS neuroimaging in developmental populations
- Longitudinal behavioral observation studies tracking capacity emergence
- Theory of mind tasks measuring social cognition milestones
- End-of-life observation and near-death experience (NDE) research methodologies

## Technical Specification Coverage
Form 35 has 4 spec files covering the full Phase 2 specification:
- **interface-spec.md** -- DevelopmentalConsciousnessInterface accepting developmental state input (current stage, history, maturation indicators, experience accumulation) and consciousness capacity input (workspace, integration, metacognitive capacity, processing speed)
- **processing-algorithms.md** -- Stage modeling (Piaget stages, consciousness emergence, cognitive milestones, neural maturation), trajectory analysis (typical development, individual variation, environmental influence, critical periods), milestone tracking (self-awareness, theory of mind, metacognition, narrative self)
- **data-structures.md** -- DevelopmentalAge (chronological, gestational, biological maturation score, experience-adjusted), developmental stage profiles, cognitive capacity trajectories, theory of mind state, metacognitive development records, end-of-life consciousness states, NDE records
- **technical-requirements.md** -- Stage classification < 50 ms, consciousness capacity assessment < 200 ms, milestone evaluation < 100 ms, full processing cycle < 1.5 s, ethical protections for sensitive developmental populations, longitudinal simulation support

## Cross-Form Relationships
| Related Form | Relationship |
|---|---|
| Form 6 (Interoceptive) | Body awareness development across the lifespan |
| Form 7 (Emotional) | Emotional development trajectory from infancy through adulthood |
| Form 10 (Self-Recognition) | Mirror test and emergence of self-awareness in early childhood |
| Form 11 (Meta-Consciousness) | Development of metacognition from childhood through adulthood |
| Form 12 (Narrative) | Autobiographical memory formation and narrative identity construction |
| Form 28 (Philosophy) | Philosophy of personal identity and continuity across developmental change |

## Unique Contributions
Form 35 provides the temporal axis for the entire consciousness project, mapping how each capacity studied in other forms first emerges, matures, and potentially declines across the human lifespan. It uniquely bookends consciousness at both extremes -- the question of when awareness begins in fetal/neonatal life and what happens to consciousness at the end of life -- raising some of the most ethically consequential questions in the project regarding fetal rights, dementia care, and end-of-life decision-making.

### Research Highlights
- Piaget (1936-1937): Foundational stage theory mapping sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational stages of cognitive development
- Gopnik: "Lantern vs. spotlight" consciousness model -- infants have diffuse, open attention unlike adult focused attention; children as Bayesian learners engaging in causal reasoning
- Spelke: Core knowledge systems (objects, agents, number, geometry) present from birth, providing innate foundations for conscious cognition
- Baillargeon: Violation-of-expectation paradigm revealing sophisticated physical reasoning in infants as young as 2.5 months
- Greyson: Near-death experience research documenting heightened awareness, life review, and consciousness phenomena at the boundary of life
