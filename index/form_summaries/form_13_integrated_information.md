# Form 13: Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

## Definition

Integrated Information Theory provides the mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness through Phi, a measure of integrated information that captures the degree to which a system generates information above and beyond its parts. Form 13 implements multi-algorithm Phi computation across scales, arousal-modulated integration, and serves as the central measurement hub for the consciousness architecture.

## Key Concepts

- **Phi Computation**: Core metric quantifying integrated information via four algorithms -- Exact IIT 3.0 (partition enumeration + Earth Mover's Distance), Gaussian Approximation (covariance-based), Real-Time Approximation (arousal-dependent detail), and Network-Based (graph theory metrics)
- **Minimum Information Partition (MIP)**: The partition that minimizes information loss, identifying the system's irreducible causal structure through exhaustive or approximated search
- **Arousal-Modulated Integration**: `ArousalModulatedIntegration` interfacing with Module 08, implementing inverted-U arousal-connectivity coupling for state-dependent Phi computation
- **Multi-Scale Hierarchy**: `MultiScalePhiComputer` computing Phi at micro (neural), meso (circuit), macro (regional), and meta (global) scales with cross-scale integration
- **Consciousness State Dependence**: `ConsciousnessStatePhiComputer` with calibrated Phi bounds per state -- wake (0.1-2.0), NREM sleep, REM, lucid dreaming, meditative, and altered states
- **Real-Time Adaptive Selection**: `AdaptivePhiComputer` dynamically choosing computation algorithm based on system size, available time, and required precision
- **Cross-Modal Binding**: Cross-modal Phi computation measuring integration across sensory modalities (Modules 01-06) for unified perceptual experience
- **Temporal Integration**: `TemporalIntegration` computing Phi across time with 100ms sliding windows for dynamic consciousness tracking

## Core Methods & Mechanisms

- **Exact IIT 3.0 Pipeline**: Enumerate all bipartitions -> compute cause-effect repertoires -> find MIP via Earth Mover's Distance -> derive Phi value (exponential complexity, used for small systems)
- **Real-Time Approximation Pipeline**: `RealTimePhiComputer` selects detail level based on arousal state (high arousal = fast approximation, optimal arousal = full computation), enabling continuous Phi monitoring at system scale
- **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture**: IIT serves as central measurement hub with bidirectional real-time coupling to Arousal (Module 08, <10ms latency), Phi-complex broadcasting to GWT (Module 14, 10-50Hz), sensory integration (Modules 01-06), and recursive meta-integration (Modules 10-12, max recursion depth 3)
- **Validation Framework**: `ComprehensivePhiValidator` with `MathematicalConsistencyValidator` (non-negativity, monotonicity, partition invariance) and `BiologicalPlausibilityValidator` (human wake Phi bounds 0.1-2.0)

## Cross-Form Relationships

| Related Form | Relationship | Integration Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Form 08 (Arousal) | Bidirectional modulation | <10ms latency coupling; arousal level determines Phi computation mode via inverted-U connectivity function |
| Form 14 (GWT) | Phi-guided broadcasting | Phi-complex content feeds global workspace competition; Phi values enhance competition scores (weight 0.20) at 10-50Hz |
| Form 15 (HOT) | Integration metric | Phi provides quantitative measure of information integration that HOT uses for consciousness level assessment |
| Forms 01-06 (Sensory) | Cross-modal binding | Cross-modal Phi computation measures integration across visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory, proprioceptive streams |
| Forms 10-12 (Higher-Order) | Recursive meta-integration | Phi computed recursively at meta-level with max recursion depth 3 for self-referential integration measurement |

## Unique Contributions

Form 13 is the sole provider of quantitative consciousness measurement through Phi, offering the only mathematically rigorous metric for determining whether and to what degree a system is conscious. Its multi-algorithm approach (exact through approximate) enables both theoretical precision and real-time practical monitoring, while its hub-and-spoke architecture makes Phi values available system-wide as a universal integration quality signal.

## Research Highlights

- **Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) validated clinically**: Casali et al. (2013) developed PCI from TMS-EEG responses, reliably distinguishing conscious from unconscious states across wake, sleep, anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness with a threshold of approximately 0.31 -- the most clinically successful IIT-derived measure
- **IIT 4.0 refines mathematical formalism**: Albantakis et al. (2023) introduced IIT 4.0, tightening the formalization with intrinsic (rather than observer-dependent) information measures and clarifying how spatial, temporal, and qualitative aspects of experience map onto causal structures
- **Templeton adversarial collaboration yields mixed results**: The Cogitate Consortium (2023) tested IIT against Global Neuronal Workspace in pre-registered experiments, finding evidence for both posterior sustained activity (supporting IIT) and frontoparietal signals (supporting GNW), leaving the debate unresolved
- **Panpsychism and the exclusion postulate**: IIT's mathematical framework implies any system with nonzero integrated information has some degree of consciousness, while the exclusion postulate establishes that only the maximum Phi complex at a given spatiotemporal grain supports conscious experience, addressing the combination problem
