## 1. Scientific Foundation

### 1.1 Key Researchers and Their Contributions

**Karl Friston** (University College London) is the most influential figure in predictive coding and the broader free energy framework. Friston's Free Energy Principle (FEP), introduced formally in "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?" (2010, Nature Reviews Neuroscience), proposes that all adaptive systems -- from single cells to entire organisms -- minimize variational free energy, which serves as an upper bound on surprise (the negative log probability of sensory observations under the system's generative model). This principle subsumes predictive coding as a specific neural implementation of free energy minimization. Friston's "active inference" framework (2017) extends the principle to action, arguing that organisms minimize surprise not only by updating their models (perception) but also by acting on the world to make their predictions come true. His work on the "Markov blanket" formalism provides a mathematical definition of system boundaries that has been applied to understand the self-organization of biological systems at all scales. Friston and Kiebel (2009) formalized hierarchical predictive coding under the free energy principle, showing how cortical microcircuits could implement approximate Bayesian inference.

**Andy Clark** (University of Edinburgh, then University of Sussex) is the leading philosophical interpreter and popularizer of predictive processing. His 2013 paper "Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science" (Behavioral and Brain Sciences) synthesized the predictive processing framework for a broad cognitive science audience. Clark's 2016 book "Surfing Uncertainty: Prediction, Action, and the Embodied Mind" (Oxford University Press) is the definitive philosophical treatment of the predictive brain hypothesis, connecting it to embodied cognition, the extended mind thesis (which Clark co-developed with Chalmers in 1998), and the nature of consciousness. Clark emphasizes the radical implications of predictive processing: perception is a kind of "controlled hallucination" constrained by sensory evidence; action is the fulfillment of predictions rather than a response to stimuli; and the boundary between mind and world is permeable and dynamic.

**Jakob Hohwy** (Monash University) provided the most rigorous philosophical analysis of the predictive mind in his 2013 book "The Predictive Mind" (Oxford University Press). Hohwy developed the "self-evidencing brain" concept (2016), arguing that the brain's predictive processing continuously generates evidence for its own existence by minimizing surprise relative to its own generative model. Hohwy's account of consciousness through predictive processing proposes that conscious experience arises from high-precision predictions that have been "explained away" -- that is, predictions for which prediction errors have been minimized. His 2015 paper "The Neural Organ Explains the Mind" addresses how predictive processing relates specifically to conscious experience.

**Anil Seth** (University of Sussex) has developed the most influential account of how predictive processing generates consciousness. Seth's "controlled hallucination" view, popularized in his 2021 bestseller "Being You: A New Science of Consciousness" (Dutton), proposes that all perception is a prediction-driven construction. His distinctive contribution is the emphasis on interoceptive prediction -- the brain's prediction of its own internal bodily states. Seth and colleagues (2013) introduced "interoceptive inference" as the basis for emotional experience and selfhood, arguing that the feeling of being a self is fundamentally a prediction about the body's internal milieu. Seth's "beast machine" concept proposes that consciousness is fundamentally about being a living organism that must regulate its internal states, connecting consciousness to biological self-regulation rather than abstract information processing.

**Rajesh Rao** (University of Washington) and **Dana Ballard** published the foundational computational paper "Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects" (1999, Nature Neuroscience), which provided the first explicit predictive coding model of cortical processing. Their model showed that a hierarchical network with top-down predictions and bottom-up error signals could explain otherwise puzzling properties of visual neurons, including end-stopping, contextual modulation, and non-classical receptive field effects.

**Thomas Metzinger** (University of Mainz) connected predictive processing to self-consciousness and phenomenal transparency. In "Being No One" (2003, MIT Press) and "The Ego Tunnel" (2009), Metzinger argued that the self is a virtual model -- the Phenomenal Self-Model (PSM) -- constructed by the brain's predictive machinery. Consciousness appears "transparent" (we don't see our perceptions as models but as direct contact with reality) because the predictive process that generates the model is itself not represented; we are, in Metzinger's terms, "naive realists about our own inner states."

**Andre Bastos, W. Martin Usrey,** and colleagues published "Canonical microcircuits for predictive coding" (2012, Neuron), proposing that cortical microcircuits are structured to implement predictive coding, with superficial layers carrying prediction errors (feedforward, in gamma frequency) and deep layers carrying predictions (feedback, in alpha/beta frequencies). This paper established the oscillatory framework for predictive coding that has since been supported by extensive electrophysiological evidence.

### 1.2 Major Discoveries

Rao and Ballard's (1999) demonstration that predictive coding explains extra-classical receptive field properties of visual neurons established the biological plausibility of the framework. Their model showed that end-stopping in V1 neurons -- the counterintuitive response suppression when a stimulus extends beyond a neuron's classical receptive field -- is a natural consequence of predictive coding: the extended stimulus is better predicted by higher-level representations, reducing the prediction error that drives V1 responses.

The discovery of the oscillatory signature of predictive coding (Bastos et al., 2012; Friston, 2019) revealed that feedforward prediction errors are carried by gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) while feedback predictions are carried by alpha/beta oscillations (8-30 Hz). This cross-frequency architecture has been confirmed in visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortex and provides a testable neural signature of predictive processing.

The mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP component elicited by deviant stimuli in a repetitive sequence, was reinterpreted as a prediction error signal (Garrido et al., 2009). The MMN is now understood as reflecting the brain's automatic detection of violations of auditory predictions, providing one of the most robust and reproducible neural signatures of predictive processing.

Seth's (2013) interoceptive inference framework demonstrated that bodily self-awareness and emotional experience can be explained through predictive processing of interoceptive signals, opening a new research domain at the intersection of predictive coding, embodiment, and consciousness.

### 1.3 Current Debates

The "dark room problem" asks why, if organisms minimize surprise, they do not simply seek the most predictable environment (a "dark room") and stay there. Friston (2012) responded that the generative model itself encodes expectations about exploration and variety: an organism that expects to encounter diverse environments would find a dark room surprising. Clark (2013) argued that active inference naturally generates exploratory behavior through "epistemic actions" that reduce uncertainty about hidden states.

The relationship between predictive coding and consciousness remains debated. Clark (2019) asked whether predictive processing is an empirical theory of neural processing (which happens to illuminate consciousness) or a theory of consciousness per se. Hohwy (2013) and Seth (2021) argue that predictive processing provides the most promising framework for understanding consciousness, while critics note that predictive processing seems to apply equally to conscious and unconscious processing, making it unclear why some predictions generate experience while others do not.

The scope of the free energy principle is debated. Some critics argue that it is an unfalsifiable framework that can accommodate any observation post hoc, while supporters argue that it makes specific, testable predictions about neural architecture, oscillatory dynamics, and behavior. Colombo and Wright (2021) raised concerns about the principle's explanatory scope and falsifiability.

## 2. Key Research Areas

### 2.1 Hierarchical Predictive Processing in Vision

The visual system is the best-studied domain for predictive coding. Research has established that visual cortex is organized as a hierarchical prediction machine, with higher areas generating predictions about expected activity in lower areas and lower areas computing prediction errors when actual input deviates from predictions. Murray, Kersten, Olshausen, Schrater, and Woods (2002) used fMRI to show that predictable stimuli produce less BOLD activation in early visual cortex than unpredictable stimuli, consistent with prediction error suppression. Kok, Jehee, and de Lange (2012) demonstrated that expected stimuli reduce neural response in V1 but enhance stimulus representation, showing that prediction and prediction error have dissociable effects on neural processing. Keller and Mrsic-Flogel (2018) provided direct evidence for predictive signals in mouse visual cortex, showing that V1 neurons encode mismatches between visual flow and locomotion-based predictions.

### 2.2 Precision Weighting and Attention

The concept of precision weighting -- the idea that the brain modulates the reliability (inverse variance) assigned to prediction errors and predictions -- has emerged as a central mechanism connecting predictive coding to attention. Feldman and Friston (2010) proposed that attention is the optimization of precision: attending to a stimulus increases the precision (and hence the influence) of prediction errors from that stimulus. This account explains key attentional phenomena: selective attention amplifies prediction errors from attended stimuli; expectation reduces prediction errors for predicted stimuli; and the interaction of attention and expectation follows from the interplay of precision weighting at different hierarchical levels. Empirically, Kok et al. (2012) and Summerfield and de Lange (2014) confirmed that attention and expectation have dissociable effects on neural processing, consistent with precision-based predictive coding.

### 2.3 Active Inference and Motor Control

Active inference extends predictive coding from perception to action. Rather than computing motor commands, the brain generates proprioceptive predictions and relies on spinal reflex arcs to minimize the resulting prediction errors by moving the body. Adams, Shipp, and Friston (2013) formalized this account in "Predictions not commands: active inference in the motor system." Wolpert, Ghahramani, and Jordan (1995) provided early evidence for forward models in motor control -- internal models that predict the sensory consequences of motor commands -- which are naturally interpreted as predictive coding in the motor system. Shadmehr and Krakauer (2008) reviewed the computational neuroanatomy of motor control through the lens of internal models, showing that the cerebellum implements forward models while basal ganglia implement model-based action selection.

### 2.4 Clinical Applications: Predictive Processing and Psychopathology

Predictive coding has been applied to understanding psychiatric and neurological disorders as disruptions of normal prediction. Corlett, Frith, and Fletcher (2009) proposed that psychosis involves disrupted prediction error signaling, with aberrant prediction errors generating false beliefs (delusions) and false percepts (hallucinations). Pellicano and Burr (2012) proposed that autism involves attenuated priors (weaker predictions), causing autistic individuals to rely more on sensory evidence and less on prediction, explaining sensory hypersensitivity and preference for predictable environments. Lawson, Rees, and Friston (2014) refined this to an "aberrant precision" account, proposing that autism involves inflexible, overly precise prediction errors rather than attenuated priors per se. Sterzer et al. (2018) provided a comprehensive computational psychiatry framework for psychosis based on predictive coding.

## 3. Major Theories and Models

### 3.1 The Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010)

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is the most general theoretical framework encompassing predictive coding. The FEP states that any self-organizing system that maintains itself against entropic decay must minimize variational free energy -- an information-theoretic quantity that bounds the surprise of its sensory observations. For neural systems, minimizing free energy is equivalent to maximizing the evidence for the system's generative model, which in turn requires accurate prediction of sensory input. The FEP provides a single principle that unifies perception (updating the model to minimize prediction errors), action (changing the world to match predictions), attention (optimizing precision), learning (updating model parameters), and model selection (choosing among alternative generative models).

### 3.2 Predictive Processing as a Theory of Consciousness (Clark, 2016; Seth, 2021)

Clark and Seth have developed the most explicit accounts of how predictive processing generates consciousness. Clark argues that consciousness is the brain's "best guess" about the causes of sensory input -- the content of the winning generative model at any moment. Perceptual experience is a "controlled hallucination": the brain generates a model of the world and controls this model by constraining it with sensory evidence. Seth adds the crucial dimension of interoception: the sense of self and presence arises from the brain's prediction of its own internal bodily states. On Seth's account, emotional feelings are interoceptive predictions (predictions about bodily states associated with different emotions), and the fundamental sense of "being someone" is a deep-level prediction about being a living body that must maintain homeostasis.

### 3.3 The Bayesian Brain Hypothesis (Knill & Pouget, 2004)

The Bayesian brain hypothesis proposes that the brain represents and processes information probabilistically, combining prior beliefs with sensory evidence through Bayes' rule. Knill and Pouget (2004) reviewed extensive evidence that perception and action follow Bayesian principles, with behavior reflecting near-optimal combination of priors and likelihoods. Predictive coding provides a neural implementation of Bayesian inference: predictions encode priors; sensory input provides likelihood; and prediction errors drive the posterior update. The Bayesian brain framework has been supported by psychophysical studies showing that humans optimally integrate visual and haptic cues (Ernst & Banks, 2002), combine sensory evidence with prior expectations in a near-Bayesian manner (Weiss, Simoncelli, & Adelson, 2002), and adaptively adjust their priors based on environmental statistics.

### 3.4 Interoceptive Inference and the Embodied Self (Seth, 2013; Barrett, 2017)

Seth's interoceptive inference framework and Barrett's theory of constructed emotion both apply predictive coding to internal bodily signals. The brain generates predictions about the body's internal state (heart rate, respiration, gut signals) and uses prediction errors from interoceptive afferents to update these models. Emotional feelings arise from the brain's interpretation of interoceptive prediction errors in the context of exteroceptive predictions about the external situation. Barrett and Simmons (2015) proposed that interoceptive predictions in the brain provide the foundational basis for emotional experience. This framework explains how emotions can be constructed differently in different cultural and contextual settings, why bodily manipulation (e.g., posture, breathing) can alter emotional experience, and why disrupted interoceptive prediction is associated with anxiety, depression, and alexithymia.

## 4. Experimental Paradigms

### 4.1 Mismatch Negativity and Predictive Auditory Processing

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is the canonical electrophysiological marker of prediction error in the auditory domain. In a typical MMN paradigm, a sequence of identical "standard" tones is interrupted by an occasional "deviant" tone differing in pitch, duration, or other features. The deviant elicits a negative-going ERP component peaking at 100-250ms, localized to auditory cortex. Garrido et al. (2009) used dynamic causal modeling to show that MMN is best explained by a predictive coding model in which the auditory cortex generates predictions about upcoming stimuli and the deviant elicits a prediction error. The MMN is generated automatically, without attention, and is preserved under some levels of anesthesia, suggesting that predictive processing operates at both conscious and unconscious levels.

### 4.2 Repetition Suppression and Expectation Suppression

Repetition suppression -- the reduction in neural response to a repeated stimulus -- has been reinterpreted through the predictive coding lens as the suppression of prediction errors when the stimulus matches the prediction. Summerfield, Trittschuh, Monti, Mesulam, and Egner (2008) showed that the magnitude of repetition suppression in face-selective visual cortex is modulated by expectation: repetition suppression is greater when repetitions are expected than when they are unexpected. This interaction between repetition and expectation is a key prediction of predictive coding that distinguishes it from simpler habituation accounts.

### 4.3 Rubber Hand Illusion and Body Ownership

The rubber hand illusion (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998) demonstrates that the brain's model of the body is a prediction that can be updated by conflicting sensory evidence. When synchronized visual and tactile stimulation is applied to a visible rubber hand and the participant's hidden real hand, the brain "recalibrates" its body model to incorporate the rubber hand, producing the illusion of ownership. Seth (2013) interpreted this through interoceptive inference: the multisensory prediction error generated by the conflicting inputs is minimized by updating the body model to include the rubber hand. Tsakiris (2010) showed that individual differences in susceptibility to the illusion correlate with interoceptive sensitivity, supporting the connection between body ownership and predictive processing of bodily signals.

### 4.4 Psychedelic Research and REBUS Model

Carhart-Harris and Friston (2019) proposed the REBUS (Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics) model, arguing that psychedelic drugs (such as psilocybin and LSD) work by relaxing the precision of high-level priors, allowing prediction errors to propagate more freely up the hierarchy. This produces the characteristic effects of psychedelics: vivid sensory experience, altered sense of self, and dissolution of habitual patterns of thought. The REBUS model makes specific predictions about changes in neural oscillatory dynamics (reduced alpha/beta power reflecting weakened top-down predictions; increased entropy reflecting enhanced prediction error propagation) that have been partially confirmed by neuroimaging studies.

### 4.5 Bistable Perception Paradigms

Bistable percepts (e.g., the Necker cube, binocular rivalry) provide natural laboratories for studying predictive processing in consciousness. In bistable perception, the sensory input is constant but conscious experience alternates between two interpretations. Hohwy, Roepstorff, and Friston (2008) modeled binocular rivalry through predictive coding, proposing that perceptual alternation reflects competition between alternative generative models, each trying to minimize prediction error. The winning model at any moment determines conscious content, while the losing model continues generating predictions in the background, eventually overtaking the winner as accumulated prediction errors favor an alternative interpretation.

## 5. Philosophical Implications

### 5.1 Perception as Controlled Hallucination

Perhaps the most radical philosophical implication of predictive coding is that all perception is a kind of hallucination constrained by sensory evidence. Seth (2021) argues that we do not perceive the world as it is; we perceive our brain's best prediction of what the world is. When sensory evidence strongly constrains the prediction (as in normal waking perception), the hallucination is "controlled" and tracks external reality. When sensory evidence is weak or absent (as in dreams, hallucinations, or sensory deprivation), the hallucination runs free. This view dissolves the traditional distinction between veridical perception and illusion: both are predictions; they differ only in how well they are constrained by evidence.

### 5.2 The Self as a Predictive Model

Predictive processing implies that the self is not a fixed entity but a continuously updated model -- a set of predictions about the body, its boundaries, and its continuity over time. Metzinger's (2003) Phenomenal Self-Model theory, Seth's (2013) interoceptive self, and Hohwy's (2016) self-evidencing brain all point to the same conclusion: the experience of being a self is a prediction that can be altered, disrupted, or enhanced by manipulating the signals that constrain the model. Depersonalization, derealization, and out-of-body experiences are understood as disruptions of the predictive self-model rather than as failures of perception per se.

### 5.3 The Hard Problem and Predictive Processing

Predictive processing does not straightforwardly solve the hard problem of consciousness -- it does not explain why prediction should feel like anything. However, proponents argue that it reframes the problem in useful ways. Seth (2021) argues that the relevant question is not "why does physical processing produce experience?" but rather "why does the brain generate this particular kind of experience?" -- a question that predictive processing can answer by pointing to the specific predictions and precision weightings that shape each conscious moment. Clark (2019) suggests that the hard problem may be an artifact of thinking about consciousness in non-predictive terms, and that a mature predictive processing account may reveal the question to be less intractable than it appears.

### 5.4 Free Will and Active Inference

Active inference reframes the question of free will. If actions are predictions-fulfilled rather than decisions-executed, the traditional notion of an agent who deliberates and then acts is replaced by a system that continuously minimizes the divergence between predictions and sensory states. Friston (2013) argues that this does not eliminate agency but redefines it: an agent is a system that actively samples the world in ways that confirm its generative model. This view is compatible with a sophisticated compatibilist account of free will, where freedom consists in the complexity and flexibility of the generative model rather than in libertarian "uncaused causes."

## 6. Cross-Form Connections

### 6.1 Connection to Form 13 (Integrated Information Theory)

Predictive coding and IIT intersect at the level of information integration. Hierarchical predictive processing inherently integrates information across cortical levels, as each level's predictions depend on the activity of multiple lower and higher levels. Hohwy (2013) argued that the free energy principle may provide the process theory that IIT lacks: while IIT specifies the structural conditions for consciousness (integrated information), predictive processing specifies the dynamic process by which integrated information is generated and updated. The question of whether predictive processing systems necessarily have high Phi, and whether high-Phi systems necessarily implement predictive processing, remains an open area of investigation.

### 6.2 Connection to Form 14 (Global Workspace Theory)

Predictive coding and GWT can be integrated by viewing the global workspace as the level of the predictive hierarchy where prediction errors are sufficiently integrated and amplified to trigger global broadcasting. Clark (2019) suggested that "globally ignited" predictions correspond to high-precision prediction errors that command system-wide updating. On this view, the global workspace implements the "best current prediction" of the organism's situation, and global broadcasting distributes this prediction (along with its associated precision) to all cortical modules. Prediction errors compete for workspace access, with high-precision, unexpected errors being most likely to achieve ignition.

### 6.3 Connection to Form 15 (Higher-Order Thought)

Predictive processing provides a natural computational implementation of higher-order thought theory. Higher-order representations can be understood as meta-level predictions about the organism's own mental states. Lau's Perceptual Reality Monitoring theory explicitly combines HOT with predictive processing: the metacognitive monitoring system generates predictions about what "real" percepts should look like and classifies internal signals accordingly. Precision weighting at the meta-level determines the confidence and clarity of conscious experience. This integration suggests that HOT and predictive processing are not competing theories but different levels of description of the same underlying process.

### 6.4 Connection to Form 17 (Recurrent Processing)

Recurrent processing is the neural mechanism that implements predictive coding. The distinction between feedforward and feedback processing in Lamme's framework corresponds directly to the distinction between bottom-up prediction errors and top-down predictions in predictive coding. Recurrent connections carry predictions from higher to lower cortical areas, while feedforward connections carry prediction errors from lower to higher areas. The temporal dynamics of recurrent processing (feedforward sweep at 0-100ms; local recurrence at 100-200ms; global recurrence at 200-500ms) correspond to successive rounds of prediction error minimization at increasingly global scales.

### 6.5 Connection to Form 18 (Primary Consciousness)

Predictive processing provides the computational mechanism underlying primary consciousness. On this view, primary consciousness arises from the brain's continuous generation of a predictive model of the current situation -- what Edelman called the "remembered present." This model integrates sensory predictions (about the external world), interoceptive predictions (about the body's internal state), and motor predictions (about the consequences of action) into a unified "scene" that constitutes the basic content of primary conscious experience. The "felt" quality of primary consciousness -- the sense that experience has a subjective character -- may arise from the interoceptive predictions that anchor the model in the living body, as Seth's "beast machine" framework suggests.
