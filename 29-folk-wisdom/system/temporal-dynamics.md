# Folk Wisdom Temporal Dynamics

## Overview
Temporal processing characteristics for folk wisdom engagement.

## Temporal Scales

### Processing Timescales
```python
class FolkWisdomTemporalScales:
    immediate_retrieval = 50  # ms - basic query response
    contextual_integration = 200  # ms - cultural context processing
    cross_cultural_synthesis = 500  # ms - multi-tradition synthesis
    deep_wisdom_access = 1000  # ms - complex wisdom integration
```

### Temporal Patterns
- **Oral tradition time**: Stories unfold over extended periods
- **Ceremonial time**: Seasonal and life-cycle rhythms
- **Ancestral time**: Intergenerational wisdom transmission
- **Sacred time**: Non-linear mythological temporality

## Synchronization Requirements
- Sync with global workspace at 20Hz minimum
- Maintain coherence with arousal state fluctuations
- Buffer for cross-cultural latency variations

## Temporal Integration
```python
class TemporalIntegration:
    def synchronize_with_global_workspace(self, wisdom_state, workspace_state):
        return self._align_temporal_frames(wisdom_state, workspace_state)
```
