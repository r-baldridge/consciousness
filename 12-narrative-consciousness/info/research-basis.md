## Developmental Psychology

### Narrative Development Stages

**Early Childhood (2-5 years)**:

- Emergence of temporal markers ("then," "next")
- Distinction between self and other in stories

**Middle Childhood (6-10 years)**:
- Complex narrative structures with goals and obstacles
- Understanding of psychological causation
- Integration of emotional states into narratives

**Adolescence (11-18 years)**:
- Abstract reasoning about identity and life themes
- Integration of past, present, and future selves
- Ideological and interpersonal identity exploration

**Early Adulthood (19-30 years)**:
- Commitment to identity narratives
- Integration of romantic and career themes
- Narrative consolidation and life direction

**Midlife (30-60 years)**:
- Generative themes and legacy concerns
- Life review and narrative revision
- Integration of achievements and disappointments

**Later Life (60+ years)**:
- Life review and meaning-making
- Wisdom themes and life lesson integration
- Death awareness and narrative completion
