# Form 30: Animal Cognition & Ethology

## Overview

Form 30 represents the consciousness system's capacity to engage with knowledge about animal minds, behavior, and consciousness. This form integrates Western scientific research (comparative psychology, cognitive ethology, neuroscience) with indigenous perspectives on animal intelligence and human-animal relationships.

## Purpose

Understanding animal cognition serves multiple purposes:

1. **Consciousness Studies**: Animals provide evidence for different forms of consciousness
2. **Ethical Insight**: Cognitive capacities inform moral consideration
3. **Evolutionary Perspective**: Understanding minds across species illuminates our own
4. **Ecological Wisdom**: Indigenous animal knowledge informs environmental ethics
5. **Cross-Species Connection**: Deepening appreciation for non-human intelligence

## Scope

### Taxonomic Coverage

Form 30 covers cognitive profiles for major taxonomic groups:

**Mammals**
- Great Apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans)
- Cetaceans (dolphins, whales, orcas, porpoises)
- Elephants (African and Asian)
- Canids (wolves, dogs, foxes)
- Felids (cats, lions, tigers)
- Other Primates (capuchins, macaques, lemurs)
- Marine Mammals (seals, sea lions, manatees)
- Rodents (rats, mice - key research subjects)
- Ungulates (horses, pigs, deer)

**Birds**
- Corvids (crows, ravens, jays, magpies)
- Parrots (African Grey, Kea, macaws)
- Raptors (eagles, owls, hawks)
- Songbirds (with vocal learning)
- Waterfowl (geese, swans)

**Other Vertebrates**
- Reptiles (monitor lizards, crocodilians, turtles)
- Amphibians (frogs with complex behavior)
- Fish (cleaner wrasse, manta rays, cichlids)

**Invertebrates**
- Cephalopods (octopuses, cuttlefish, squid)
- Social Insects (bees, ants, termites)
- Arachnids (jumping spiders)

### Cognition Domains

For each species, we track evidence across domains:

1. **Memory Systems**
   - Episodic memory (what-where-when)
   - Working memory capacity
   - Spatial cognition and navigation

2. **Learning & Problem Solving**
   - Social learning and imitation
   - Tool use and manufacture
   - Causal reasoning
   - Planning and future thinking

3. **Social Cognition**
   - Theory of mind / perspective taking
   - Cooperation and reciprocity
   - Deception and tactical behavior
   - Empathy and emotional contagion
   - Fairness sensitivity

4. **Self-Awareness**
   - Mirror self-recognition
   - Metacognition (knowing what you know)
   - Self-agency understanding

5. **Communication**
   - Referential signals
   - Syntax and combinatorics
   - Language comprehension (trained subjects)

6. **Emotional Processing**
   - Emotional expressions
   - Grief and mourning
   - Play behavior

### Consciousness Indicators

Form 30 tracks multiple types of evidence:

- **Behavioral**: Observable actions suggesting cognition
- **Neuroanatomical**: Brain structures associated with consciousness
- **Neurophysiological**: Neural activity patterns (e.g., sleep cycles)
- **Pharmacological**: Responses to consciousness-affecting drugs
- **Self-Report Proxy**: Trained language use in some species
- **Indigenous Observation**: Traditional knowledge about animal minds

## Integration with Other Forms

### Form 28 (Philosophy)
- Philosophy of mind implications
- Animal consciousness debates
- Moral status of animals
- Cognitive continuity vs. discontinuity arguments

### Form 29 (Folk Wisdom)
- IndigenousAnimalWisdom ↔ SpeciesCognitionProfile links
- Traditional ecological knowledge validation
- Spirit animal traditions with behavioral science
- Cross-reference between scientific and indigenous perspectives

### Form 10 (Memory)
- Shared embedding space for retrieval
- Animal cognition knowledge alongside other memories

### Form 11 (Meta-Consciousness)
- Reflection on animal consciousness studies
- Meta-awareness of human-animal continuity

## Data Models

See `spec/data-models.md` for detailed dataclass definitions:

- `SpeciesCognitionProfile`: Comprehensive profile per species
- `AnimalBehaviorInsight`: Specific behavioral observations/experiments
- `CrossSpeciesSynthesis`: Comparisons across species
- `IndigenousAnimalKnowledge`: Traditional perspectives (links to Form 29)
- `ConsciousnessTheoryApplication`: How theories apply to species

## Research Sources

Form 30 draws on:

- Peer-reviewed ethology and comparative psychology literature
- Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness (2012)
- Notable research programs (Goodall, de Waal, Pepperberg, etc.)
- Indigenous knowledge via Form 29
- Zoo and sanctuary observations
- Field studies and wildlife research

## Ethical Considerations

Research on animal cognition raises ethical issues:

1. **Invasive Research**: Balancing knowledge gains with animal welfare
2. **Captivity Effects**: How captivity affects cognitive expression
3. **Anthropomorphism Balance**: Avoiding both over- and under-attribution
4. **Moral Implications**: How cognitive findings affect ethical treatment

## Maturity Model

Animal cognition knowledge matures through:

1. **Species Coverage**: Number of species with profiles
2. **Domain Depth**: Evidence coverage across cognition domains
3. **Source Diversity**: Multiple research paradigms represented
4. **Indigenous Integration**: Links to Form 29 animal wisdom
5. **Evidence Quality**: Peer-reviewed, replicated findings
