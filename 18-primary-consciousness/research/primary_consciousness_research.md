## 1. Scientific Foundation

### 1.1 Key Researchers and Their Contributions

**Gerald M. Edelman** (1929-2014, The Neurosciences Institute, La Jolla) was the Nobel Prize-winning immunologist who became the most influential theorist of primary consciousness. Edelman received the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the structure of antibodies, and his subsequent career was devoted to applying selectionist principles from immunology to neuroscience. His Theory of Neuronal Group Selection (TNGS), also known as Neural Darwinism, proposed that the brain operates through a process of selective amplification of neuronal groups rather than instructive programming, drawing a deep analogy between the immune system's generation of antibody diversity through clonal selection and the brain's development of functional circuits through experiential selection. Edelman's 1989 book "The Remembered Present: A Biological Theory of Consciousness" laid out the first comprehensive biological theory of primary consciousness, distinguishing it sharply from higher-order consciousness. His central claim was that primary consciousness -- the basic subjective awareness of a multimodal "scene" integrated from current perception and value-laden memory -- arises from reentrant signaling between posterior cortical areas handling perceptual categorization and anterior cortical/subcortical areas handling value-category memory. Edelman elaborated this framework in "Bright Air, Brilliant Fire" (1992), "A Universe of Consciousness" (with Giulio Tononi, 2000), and "Wider than the Sky" (2004), progressively refining the neural mechanisms and philosophical implications of primary consciousness.

**Giulio Tononi** (University of Wisconsin-Madison) was Edelman's most significant scientific collaborator and intellectual successor. Tononi worked with Edelman at The Neurosciences Institute throughout the 1990s, co-developing the dynamic core hypothesis and contributing the mathematical formalism that would eventually lead to Integrated Information Theory. Their joint 1998 paper "Consciousness and Complexity" in Science introduced the dynamic core concept, arguing that consciousness requires a neural process that is simultaneously highly integrated (binding diverse information into a unified experience) and highly differentiated (capable of distinguishing among a vast repertoire of states). Tononi and Edelman's co-authored book "A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination" (2000) presented the most complete joint account of their theory, synthesizing reentrant dynamics, the dynamic core, and the neural basis of qualia. Tononi later developed Integrated Information Theory as a more abstract mathematical formalization of insights initially grounded in Edelman's biological framework.

**Joseph Gally** collaborated with Edelman on foundational papers on neural group selection and degeneracy in neural systems. Gally and Edelman (1993) published the influential paper "The role of degeneracy and redundancy in the defense of biological systems" and contributed to understanding how neural degeneracy -- the ability of structurally distinct neural elements to produce equivalent functional outputs -- enables the robustness and adaptability of primary consciousness.

**Olaf Sporns** (Indiana University) worked with Edelman and Tononi on the computational modeling of neuronal group selection and reentrant dynamics. Sporns and Edelman (1993) developed large-scale simulations of brain-based devices demonstrating how selectionist principles operating through reentrant connectivity could give rise to perceptual categorization without explicit programming. Sporns subsequently became a pioneer of connectomics, applying network science to the analysis of brain architecture, and his work on brain network topology has been instrumental in understanding the structural basis for the integration and differentiation properties that Edelman identified as prerequisites for primary consciousness.

**Karl Friston** (University College London) developed the free energy principle and active inference framework, which provides a complementary process-theoretic account of how organisms maintain their integrity by minimizing surprise. While Friston's framework is most directly associated with predictive coding (Form 16), his treatment of interoceptive inference and the Markov blanket formalism has significant implications for understanding primary consciousness as the felt experience of an organism maintaining itself as a bounded, self-organizing system. Friston (2010) in "The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?" explicitly connected his framework to consciousness, and subsequent work by Friston, Wiese, and Hobson (2020) in "Sentience and the Origins of Consciousness: From Cartesian Duality to Markovian Monism" argued that primary consciousness arises from the inference processes that constitute a system's Markov blanket.

**Jaak Panksepp** (1943-2017, Washington State University) was the founder of affective neuroscience and a critical contributor to understanding the subcortical foundations of primary consciousness. Panksepp argued, in contrast to cortex-centric theories, that primary consciousness has deep subcortical roots in ancient emotional systems. His 1998 book "Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions" identified seven primary emotional systems (SEEKING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, CARE, PANIC/GRIEF, PLAY) implemented in subcortical circuits that he argued constitute the evolutionary foundation of conscious experience. Panksepp's 2012 paper with Biven, "The Archaeology of Mind," argued that raw affective experience represents the most primitive form of primary consciousness, predating and undergirding all perceptual consciousness.

**Antonio Damasio** (University of Southern California) developed the somatic marker hypothesis and a comprehensive framework for understanding consciousness through the body's role in generating feeling states. Damasio's 1999 book "The Feeling of What Happens" distinguished between a "core consciousness" (closely related to Edelman's primary consciousness) arising from the organism's registration of how its own body state is modified by encounters with objects, and an "extended consciousness" built upon autobiographical memory. Damasio (2010) in "Self Comes to Mind" further developed his account of the "proto-self" (a neural representation of the body's current state) as the foundation upon which all conscious experience is built, arguing that feelings are the most fundamental conscious phenomena because they express the organism's homeostatic condition.

**Bjorn Merker** published a landmark 2007 paper in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, "Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine," arguing that children born with hydranencephaly (lacking a cerebral cortex) display behavioral signs of primary consciousness including purposive behavior, emotional responses, and environmental awareness. Merker proposed that the brainstem and subcortical structures, particularly the superior colliculus and periaqueductal gray, can sustain primary consciousness independently of the cortex, challenging the cortex-centric assumptions of most consciousness theories.

**Derek Denton** (University of Melbourne) advanced the concept of "primordial emotions" as the evolutionary origin of consciousness. In his 2005 book "The Primordial Emotions: The Dawning of Consciousness," Denton argued that the most basic conscious experiences are interoceptive imperatives -- thirst, hunger, air hunger, pain -- that evolved to motivate homeostatic behavior. These primordial emotions, Denton proposed, represent the phylogenetic origin of primary consciousness and are mediated by ancient brainstem and diencephalic circuits.

### 1.2 Major Discoveries

Edelman and Tononi's articulation of the dynamic core hypothesis (1998) was a foundational discovery, providing the first formal characterization of how a subset of neurons in the thalamocortical system could form a functional cluster that is simultaneously highly integrated and highly differentiated. Their analysis showed that the dynamic core is not a fixed anatomical structure but a process -- a continuously shifting coalition of neuronal groups bound by reentrant signaling, capable of generating the vast repertoire of discriminable states that corresponds to the richness of conscious experience.

The experimental validation of reentrant signaling as a neural mechanism was advanced by Engel, Kreiter, Konig, and Singer (1991), who demonstrated long-range synchronization between distant cortical areas in the gamma frequency range (30-70 Hz), providing electrophysiological evidence for the kind of reentrant binding that Edelman's theory required. Subsequent work by Rodriguez et al. (1999) showed that conscious face perception is accompanied by transient long-distance gamma synchronization between occipital and frontal areas, while failure of conscious perception corresponds to the absence of such synchronization.

Sporns, Tononi, and Edelman (2000) developed large-scale computational models of the thalamocortical system demonstrating that reentrant connectivity among neuronal groups with selectionist organization produces emergent properties consistent with primary consciousness, including contextual integration, perceptual categorization, and the binding of multimodal information without a central executive.

Merker's (2007) observations of hydranencephalic children constituted a major empirical challenge to cortex-centric theories. These children, despite lacking virtually all cerebral cortex, displayed purposive behavior including emotional expressiveness, social interaction, preferential looking, and musical preferences. While the interpretation of these observations remains debated, they provided compelling evidence that some form of primary consciousness can be sustained by subcortical structures.

Panksepp's deep brain stimulation studies in animals (reviewed in Panksepp, 1998; Panksepp & Biven, 2012) demonstrated that electrical stimulation of specific subcortical circuits produces coherent emotional-behavioral responses that animals will work to obtain or avoid, providing evidence for the conscious nature of subcortical affective states. Damasio's lesion studies in human patients (1994, 1999) showed that damage to somatosensory and insular cortex impairs emotional feeling and decision-making, supporting the role of body-state representations in primary consciousness.

### 1.3 Current Debates

The cortical versus subcortical debate remains one of the most contested issues in primary consciousness research. Edelman, Tononi, and most information-theoretic approaches locate primary consciousness in the thalamocortical system, while Panksepp, Merker, Damasio, and Denton argue that the most fundamental forms of consciousness are subcortical and affective. This debate has practical implications for animal consciousness (if primary consciousness requires cortex, it is restricted to mammals and possibly birds; if it is subcortical, it may extend to all vertebrates and possibly some invertebrates) and for clinical assessment (if subcortical structures can sustain consciousness, then cortical damage alone does not necessarily eliminate consciousness).

The relationship between primary and higher-order consciousness is debated. Edelman drew a sharp distinction: primary consciousness is a "remembered present" without language, self-reflection, or temporal extension, while higher-order consciousness requires linguistic and conceptual capacities that enable narrative self-awareness. Critics argue that this distinction is too sharp and that intermediate forms of consciousness exist that blur the boundary.

The role of the body in primary consciousness generates significant disagreement. Damasio and the embodied cognition tradition argue that consciousness is fundamentally grounded in bodily self-representation, while computational and information-theoretic approaches (IIT, GWT) treat consciousness as potentially independent of bodily substrates. This debate connects to broader questions about whether artificial systems could achieve primary consciousness.

The explanatory sufficiency of selectionist and reentrant mechanisms is questioned. While Edelman's theory provides a detailed biological account of how neural circuits develop and interact, critics argue that it does not fully explain why reentrant processes should be conscious rather than merely functional. This critique parallels the "hard problem" objection raised against all neuroscientific theories of consciousness.

## 2. Key Research Areas

### 2.1 Neural Darwinism and Neuronal Group Selection

Edelman's Theory of Neuronal Group Selection (TNGS) proposes three fundamental processes. Developmental selection creates the primary repertoire of neuronal groups through activity-dependent and molecular cue-guided processes during embryogenesis and early postnatal development. Experiential selection shapes the secondary repertoire by strengthening synaptic connections within and between neuronal groups based on behavioral experience, analogous to the clonal expansion of antibodies that match encountered antigens. Reentrant mapping provides the mechanism by which spatially separated neuronal groups coordinate their activity through reciprocal connections, enabling the integration of information across cortical maps without the need for a central coordinator or explicit programming. Edelman and Gally (2001) further articulated the concept of neural degeneracy -- the ability of structurally different neural elements to perform the same function -- as a key property that ensures the robustness of selection-based neural computation and distinguishes it from engineered redundancy.

### 2.2 Reentrant Dynamics and the Dynamic Core

Reentrant signaling is the central neural mechanism in Edelman's account of primary consciousness. Reentry is defined as the ongoing, recursive, bidirectional exchange of signals along massively parallel anatomical connections linking cortical areas, cortical and subcortical structures, and different thalamic nuclei. Edelman distinguished reentry from simple feedback, which involves a single pathway carrying an error signal, and from feedforward processing, which transmits information in one direction only. Reentry involves the simultaneous reciprocal signaling between multiple neural maps, enabling the correlation of independently derived perceptual categorizations across different sensory modalities and spatial scales. Tononi and Edelman (1998) formalized the dynamic core as a subset of the thalamocortical system characterized by high mutual information among its elements (integration) and high entropy of the ensemble (differentiation), providing a quantitative criterion for identifying the neural substrate of primary consciousness.

### 2.3 Value-Category Memory and the Remembered Present

Edelman proposed that primary consciousness arises specifically from the reentrant interaction between current perceptual categorization (mediated by posterior cortical areas) and value-category memory (mediated by hippocampal, limbic, and brainstem systems). Value-category memory links perceptual categories to adaptive value -- the significance of stimuli for the organism's survival and well-being -- through connections between cortical categorization areas and subcortical value systems (the brainstem nuclei that regulate arousal, reward, and emotion). Primary consciousness is the "remembered present" -- the integration of current perceptual categorizations with past value-laden associations, creating a coherent "scene" that situates the organism in its environment and guides behavior. This scene is not a replayed memory but a dynamically constructed, context-dependent categorization of the current situation in light of the organism's history and needs.

### 2.4 Subcortical Foundations and Affective Consciousness

Research on the subcortical foundations of primary consciousness has expanded significantly since Panksepp's initial work. Damasio and Carvalho (2013) developed the concept of "homeostatic feelings" as the most primitive form of consciousness, arising from the brainstem's mapping of the body's internal milieu. Solms and Friston (2018) proposed a synthesis of Freudian drive theory, affective neuroscience, and the free energy principle, arguing that consciousness originates in the subcortical systems that monitor and regulate the organism's homeostatic state. Northoff and Huang (2017) introduced the concept of "temporo-spatial theory of consciousness," arguing that primary consciousness depends on the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in both cortical and subcortical structures. Barron and Klein (2016), in "What insects can tell us about the origins of consciousness," argued on functional and anatomical grounds that insect central complexes may support a form of primary consciousness, extending the subcortical consciousness argument beyond vertebrates.

## 3. Major Theories and Models

### 3.1 Edelman's Theory of Primary Consciousness (1989, 2000)

Edelman's theory distinguishes primary consciousness from higher-order consciousness along multiple dimensions. Primary consciousness is present-oriented, non-linguistic, non-self-reflective, and shared (in some form) with many animal species. It provides the organism with an integrated "scene" -- a multimodal representation of the current situation enriched by value-category memory. Higher-order consciousness, unique to humans and possibly great apes, adds linguistic categorization, narrative self-reference, and temporal extension (the ability to represent past and future). The transition from primary to higher-order consciousness requires the evolution of Broca's and Wernicke's areas and the development of syntactic linguistic capacity, which enables the organism to construct symbolic models of its own states and project them across time.

The neural architecture underlying primary consciousness, as specified by Edelman, requires: (1) ongoing perceptual categorization by posterior cortical areas organized in reentrant maps; (2) a value system implemented by brainstem nuclei (locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area) and their diffuse cortical projections; (3) a memory system (hippocampal and limbic circuits) that links categories to values; and (4) reentrant connectivity between perceptual categorization systems and value-category memory systems, mediated in part by the thalamocortical system. When these components are active and reciprocally connected, the organism experiences a "remembered present" -- a primary conscious scene.

### 3.2 The Dynamic Core Hypothesis (Tononi & Edelman, 1998)

The dynamic core hypothesis formalizes Edelman's biological theory in information-theoretic terms. The core claim is that primary consciousness is associated with a "functional cluster" of neuronal groups in the thalamocortical system that exhibits two properties simultaneously: (1) high integration, meaning that the elements of the cluster share substantial mutual information and cannot be decomposed into independent subsets without significant information loss; and (2) high differentiation, meaning that the cluster can access a vast number of distinguishable states, each corresponding to a distinct conscious experience. Tononi and Edelman demonstrated computationally that the thalamocortical system's architecture -- with its recurrent connectivity, laminar organization, and convergent-divergent projection patterns -- is uniquely suited to generate a dynamic core with the required properties. The "dynamic" qualifier reflects the fact that the core's composition changes continuously as different neuronal groups enter and leave the functional cluster on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds.

### 3.3 Damasio's Core Consciousness (1999, 2010)

Damasio's account of core consciousness (his term for what Edelman calls primary consciousness) centers on the body. Core consciousness arises when the brain generates "second-order maps" that represent how the organism's own body state (the "proto-self") is modified by its encounter with an object. The proto-self is a collection of neural patterns representing the current state of the body -- interoceptive signals, musculoskeletal configuration, visceral conditions. When the organism perceives an object, the proto-self is modified, and a "second-order" neural structure maps the relationship between the original proto-self, the object representation, and the modified proto-self. This mapping generates what Damasio calls a "feeling of knowing" -- the basic conscious experience that something is being experienced by someone. Core consciousness is transient, tied to the current moment, and does not require language or extended memory. Damasio locates the key neural substrates for core consciousness in the upper brainstem nuclei, the hypothalamus, the insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortices.

### 3.4 Panksepp's Affective Consciousness (1998, 2012)

Panksepp's affective neuroscience framework posits that primary consciousness is fundamentally affective -- that the first conscious experiences in evolution were raw emotional feelings, not perceptual representations. Panksepp identified seven genetically encoded primary emotional systems implemented in ancient subcortical circuits: SEEKING (anticipatory enthusiasm), RAGE (anger), FEAR (anxiety), LUST (sexual desire), CARE (nurturance), PANIC/GRIEF (separation distress), and PLAY (social joy). These systems, concentrated in the periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, and extended amygdala, generate coherent emotional-behavioral states that, Panksepp argued, are intrinsically conscious. Evidence for their conscious nature comes from deep brain stimulation studies showing that animals will work to activate or avoid activation of specific emotional circuits, and from human patients who report intense emotional experiences when homologous structures are stimulated. Panksepp (2005) argued in "Affective consciousness: Core emotional feelings in animals and humans" that affect is the "ancestral form of consciousness" from which all other conscious experience evolved.

### 3.5 Merker's Subcortical Consciousness (2007)

Merker proposed a model in which primary consciousness is generated by the brainstem's "action selection" system centered on the superior colliculus and periaqueductal gray. In this model, the colliculus integrates multimodal sensory information into a coherent spatial representation that guides orienting behavior, while the periaqueductal gray provides the motivational and affective context. This subcortical system constitutes a "consciousness machine" that predates the evolution of the neocortex and can sustain basic conscious experience in its absence, as suggested by the behavior of hydranencephalic children. Merker's model emphasizes that consciousness is primarily about action selection -- creating a unified representation of the current situation that enables the organism to choose among competing behavioral options.

## 4. Experimental Paradigms

### 4.1 Brain-Based Devices and Synthetic Neural Modeling

Edelman and his colleagues at The Neurosciences Institute developed a series of "brain-based devices" -- physical robots controlled by simulated nervous systems organized according to TNGS principles. Darwin III through Darwin X (Edelman, 2007) demonstrated that selectionist architectures with reentrant connectivity could develop perceptual categorization, value-dependent learning, and conditioned behavior without explicit programming. Darwin VII, for example, developed the ability to categorize objects by shape and to associate categories with hedonic values, demonstrating the kind of value-category coupling that Edelman identified as a prerequisite for primary consciousness. While these devices were not claimed to be conscious, they demonstrated the functional plausibility of Edelman's neural architecture and provided a proof of concept for how selectionist mechanisms could generate the behavioral capacities associated with primary consciousness.

### 4.2 Gamma Synchrony and Binding Studies

Experimental investigation of the reentrant binding mechanisms central to Edelman's theory has relied heavily on measurements of gamma-band (30-70 Hz) neural synchrony. Singer and Gray (1995) demonstrated stimulus-dependent gamma synchronization in cat visual cortex, showing that neurons responding to different features of the same object synchronize their firing in the gamma range while neurons responding to different objects do not. Rodriguez et al. (1999) extended this to human perception, showing that conscious face recognition is accompanied by transient long-distance gamma synchrony between occipital, parietal, and frontal areas, while failure of recognition correlates with desynchronization. Melloni et al. (2007) used a masking paradigm to show that conscious perception of briefly presented words is specifically associated with a burst of induced gamma-band activity and long-range gamma synchrony, supporting the role of reentrant binding in primary consciousness.

### 4.3 Sleep and Dreaming Studies

The transition between waking, NREM sleep, and REM sleep provides a natural model for studying changes in primary consciousness. Massimini et al. (2005) used TMS-EEG to show that during NREM sleep, the cortex loses the capacity for complex reentrant responses to perturbation -- a TMS pulse produces only a local, stereotyped wave rather than the widespread, differentiated response seen during waking and REM sleep. This finding supports Edelman and Tononi's prediction that primary consciousness requires intact reentrant dynamics. Siclari et al. (2017) used serial awakening protocols with high-density EEG to show that dreaming during NREM sleep (an instance of primary consciousness without environmental input) is associated with activation of posterior cortical areas, particularly the "hot zone" of parieto-occipital cortex, consistent with theories that locate primary consciousness in posterior cortical perceptual systems.

### 4.4 Studies of Consciousness in Non-Mammalian Species

Primary consciousness theory makes predictions about the distribution of consciousness across species based on neural architecture. Nieder et al. (2020) demonstrated that crows display neural activity patterns in their pallium (the avian homolog of mammalian cortex) that correlate with subjective perception in a visual detection task, providing evidence for a form of primary consciousness in birds despite their radically different brain architecture. Godfrey-Smith (2016) analyzed the nervous system of cephalopods (octopus, cuttlefish) and argued that their distributed nervous system with semi-autonomous arm ganglia may support a different kind of primary consciousness -- one that is less unified than mammalian consciousness but nevertheless subjectively experienced. These studies extend the scope of primary consciousness research beyond mammals and test the generality of Edelman's architectural requirements.

### 4.5 Lesion and Clinical Studies

Clinical studies of patients with specific brain lesions have been crucial for testing theories of primary consciousness. Boly et al. (2017) in their systematic review compared lesion evidence with predictions from IIT, GWT, HOT, and recurrent processing theories, finding that damage to the posterior cortical "hot zone" most consistently impairs conscious experience, while prefrontal damage affects cognitive access and control but often spares phenomenal consciousness. Damasio's case studies of patients with insular and somatosensory cortex damage (1994, 1999) showed that damage to body-mapping areas impairs emotional feeling and aspects of core consciousness, supporting his somatic marker hypothesis. Studies of akinetic mutism following cingulate cortex damage (Damasio & Van Hoesen, 1983) showed that damage to regions connecting motivational and motor systems produces a state of preserved wakefulness without apparent volitional consciousness.

### 4.6 Developmental Studies of Primary Consciousness

Investigating when primary consciousness emerges during development provides evidence about its necessary neural substrates. Lagercrantz and Changeux (2009) reviewed evidence on consciousness emergence in human development, arguing that primary consciousness emerges at approximately 24-28 weeks of gestational age when thalamocortical connections mature sufficiently to support reentrant signaling. Dehaene-Lambertz et al. (2002) showed that neonates display neural signatures of conscious processing (late ERP components analogous to adult P300) in response to auditory stimuli, indicating some form of primary consciousness shortly after birth. These developmental findings constrain theories by linking the emergence of consciousness to specific maturational events in neural architecture.

## 5. Philosophical Implications

### 5.1 Primary Consciousness and the Hard Problem

Primary consciousness represents the core of Chalmers' (1995) "hard problem" -- explaining why there is subjective experience at all. While theories of higher-order consciousness can appeal to functional roles (monitoring, reporting, metacognition) to explain why consciousness exists, primary consciousness resists such functionalist explanations precisely because it is the most basic form of experience that precedes all cognitive elaboration. Edelman attempted to deflect the hard problem by arguing that once the neural mechanisms of primary consciousness are fully understood, the question of "why" subjective experience accompanies those mechanisms will dissolve, analogously to how understanding DNA dissolved the mystery of the "vital force." Critics, including Chalmers (1996) and Levine (1983), argue that this response conflates the "easy problems" of consciousness (explaining functions, behaviors, and neural correlates) with the hard problem (explaining why there is subjective experience).

### 5.2 Animal Consciousness and Moral Status

Primary consciousness theory has direct implications for animal ethics. If primary consciousness -- basic subjective experience -- is present in organisms with the requisite neural architecture, then a vast range of animals possess morally relevant conscious experiences. The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness (2012), signed by a group of prominent neuroscientists including Edelman collaborator Christof Koch, stated that "the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness" and that "non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates." Panksepp's work on subcortical emotional systems further extends moral consideration by arguing that mammals share fundamental affective consciousness systems, making their suffering qualitatively similar to human suffering.

### 5.3 The Relationship Between Consciousness and Life

Edelman's selectionist framework draws a deep connection between consciousness and biological life. The principles underlying primary consciousness -- variation, selection, amplification, competition -- are the same principles underlying evolution by natural selection and immune recognition. This has led to the suggestion, developed by Thompson (2007) in "Mind in Life" and by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch (1991) in "The Embodied Mind," that consciousness and life are deeply intertwined -- that consciousness is not an incidental byproduct of neural complexity but is inherent in the self-organizing dynamics of living systems. This "deep continuity" thesis contrasts sharply with computational approaches (including IIT) that define consciousness in substrate-independent terms that could, in principle, apply to non-living systems.

### 5.4 Implications for Artificial Consciousness

Primary consciousness theory has significant implications for the possibility of machine consciousness. Edelman was skeptical about the possibility of conscious computers, arguing that primary consciousness requires a specific type of biological organization -- selectionist neural architecture with value systems grounded in bodily homeostasis -- that cannot be replicated by algorithmic computation on von Neumann architectures. Edelman (2006) in "Second Nature" argued that "the brain is not a computer" and that consciousness requires the embodied, selectionist dynamics of biological neural tissue. This position contrasts with IIT (which is substrate-independent), GWT (which can be computationally implemented), and functionalist approaches (which define consciousness by abstract functional organization). The question of whether primary consciousness requires biological substrates or can be achieved in silicon remains one of the most fundamental open questions in consciousness science.

### 5.5 Phenomenological Structure of Primary Consciousness

Primary consciousness has a distinctive phenomenological character that philosophical analysis has sought to articulate. It is prereflective -- experienced without being reflected upon. It is perspectival -- always experienced from a first-person point of view. It is temporally thick -- not instantaneous but extended over a "specious present" of approximately 2-3 seconds (Varela, 1999). It is multimodal -- integrating diverse sensory channels into a unified scene. And it is valenced -- always accompanied by some degree of hedonic tone (pleasantness or unpleasantness) reflecting the organism's homeostatic state. These phenomenological properties constrain theories of primary consciousness: any adequate theory must explain not only that there is experience but why experience has this particular structure.

## 6. Cross-Form Connections

### 6.1 Connection to Form 13 (Integrated Information Theory)

IIT originated directly from Edelman and Tononi's work on primary consciousness. The dynamic core hypothesis -- with its emphasis on integration and differentiation -- served as the conceptual precursor to IIT's central measure, Phi. Where Edelman's framework is biological and process-oriented, describing how reentrant selection generates integrated neural dynamics, Tononi's IIT is mathematical and structure-oriented, characterizing the intrinsic cause-effect structure that constitutes consciousness. The two frameworks agree that consciousness requires simultaneous integration and differentiation of information, but diverge on whether consciousness is substrate-independent (IIT says yes, Edelman says no) and on whether consciousness can be fully characterized by a mathematical quantity (IIT says Phi captures the level of consciousness, while Edelman emphasized that biological processes resist complete mathematical formalization). IIT can be understood as an abstract formalization of insights about consciousness that Edelman grounded in evolutionary biology and neuronal group selection.

### 6.2 Connection to Form 14 (Global Workspace Theory)

Edelman's primary consciousness and Baars' Global Workspace Theory share the insight that consciousness involves the widespread sharing of information across neural systems, but they frame this sharing differently. For Edelman, consciousness arises from reentrant signaling that binds perceptual categorization with value-category memory -- it is a biological process rooted in selectionist dynamics. For Baars and Dehaene, consciousness arises from competitive selection and global broadcasting within a cognitive architecture -- it is a computational process that can be described in information-processing terms. The two theories converge on the prediction that consciousness requires widespread cortical activation (Edelman's reentrant loops, Dehaene's global ignition) and diverge on the role of prefrontal cortex (which GNW emphasizes as the broadcasting hub but which Edelman's theory does not assign a privileged role for primary consciousness). Primary consciousness in Edelman's sense is more basic than the cognitive "access" that GWT describes, suggesting that GWT may capture higher-order or access-level consciousness rather than the more fundamental phenomenal awareness that Edelman sought to explain.

### 6.3 Connection to Form 15 (Higher-Order Thought)

The distinction between primary and higher-order consciousness that is central to Form 18 directly engages Higher-Order Thought theories. Edelman's primary consciousness is explicitly pre-reflective -- it does not involve thoughts about one's own mental states. HOT theorists like Rosenthal (2005) would argue that such prereflective states are not genuinely conscious, since consciousness requires a higher-order representation of the first-order state. This is a fundamental disagreement about what consciousness is: Edelman claims that a dog perceiving a scene has primary consciousness without any meta-cognitive awareness of that perception, while strong HOT theorists would deny that such a state is conscious in the relevant sense. Lau's (2019) Perceptual Reality Monitoring theory offers a potential bridge, suggesting that some forms of higher-order processing (reality monitoring rather than explicit self-reflection) may be automatic enough to operate in animals, thus reconciling the intuition that animals are conscious with the higher-order requirement.

### 6.4 Connection to Form 16 (Predictive Coding)

Predictive coding provides a complementary process-theoretic account of the computations underlying primary consciousness. Where Edelman described reentrant signaling between cortical maps, predictive coding describes hierarchical predictions flowing top-down and prediction errors flowing bottom-up through the same recurrent cortical circuits. Seth (2013) explicitly connected predictive processing to primary consciousness through his "beast machine" framework, arguing that primary consciousness arises from interoceptive predictions about the body's internal state, echoing Damasio's somatic emphasis. Clark (2016) in "Surfing Uncertainty" suggested that the "controlled hallucination" generated by the predictive hierarchy constitutes the contents of primary consciousness -- a prediction-based model of the current situation that closely parallels Edelman's "remembered present." The active inference framework (Friston, 2010) adds a dynamic dimension by showing how organisms maintain their primary conscious field through active sampling of the environment -- a selectionist process that resonates with Edelman's Neural Darwinism.

### 6.5 Connection to Form 17 (Recurrent Processing)

Lamme's Recurrent Processing Theory shares with Edelman's account the fundamental claim that feedback (recurrent) connections are necessary for consciousness while feedforward processing is unconscious. Lamme (2006) proposed that "recurrent processing" -- feedback signals from higher to lower cortical areas -- generates phenomenal consciousness even without cognitive access, a position that aligns closely with Edelman's primary consciousness. Both theories predict that the earliest cortical processing of a stimulus (the feedforward sweep, ~100ms) is unconscious, and that consciousness emerges when recurrent signals establish reentrant loops (~150-200ms). Where Edelman emphasized the specific content of reentrant signaling (the interaction between perceptual categorization and value-category memory), Lamme's theory focuses more broadly on the temporal dynamics of feedforward versus recurrent processing and the distinction between phenomenal consciousness (which arises from local recurrence) and access consciousness (which requires widespread recurrent processing engaging frontal areas). Both theories predict that interrupting recurrent processing through backward masking or TMS at the critical time window abolishes consciousness while leaving feedforward processing intact.
