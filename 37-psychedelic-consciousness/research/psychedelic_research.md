### Entropic Brain Hypothesis

#### Core Theory (Carhart-Harris, 2014)
- Consciousness exists on a spectrum of entropy
- Normal waking consciousness represents constrained, low-entropy state
- Psychedelics increase entropy (disorder/randomness) in brain activity
- Higher entropy = more flexible, unconstrained cognition

#### Key Principles

**Primary Consciousness vs. Secondary Consciousness**
- Primary: unconstrained, present-moment, infant-like (high entropy)
- Secondary: constrained, ego-bound, reality-tested (low entropy)
- Psychedelics move consciousness toward primary state

**Default Mode Network (DMN)**
- DMN activity correlates with sense of self, autobiographical memory
- Psychedelics decrease DMN activity and integrity
- DMN disruption correlates with ego dissolution
- May explain therapeutic effects through "resetting" rigid patterns

**Therapeutic Implications**
- Mental disorders characterized by overly rigid, constrained cognition
- Depression: stuck in negative thought patterns (low entropy)
- Psychedelics increase cognitive flexibility
- "Shaking the snow globe" metaphor

**Criticisms and Refinements**
- Entropy measurement methodology debated
- REBUS model (2019) provides more nuanced framework
- Not all high-entropy states are therapeutic
- Set and setting crucial for outcomes

## 5. Neuroscience

### Default Mode Network (DMN) Disruption

#### DMN Overview
**Definition and Function**
- Network active during rest, self-reflection, mind-wandering
- Key regions: medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, angular gyrus
- Functions: Self-referential processing, autobiographical memory, theory of mind
- Sense of self and personal narrative

**Psychedelic Effects on DMN**
- Decreased activity and integrity
- Reduced connectivity within network
- Disrupted alpha oscillations (posterior cingulate)
- Correlates with ego dissolution intensity

**Research Findings**
- Carhart-Harris et al. (2012): First psilocybin fMRI study
- LSD produces "disintegration" of DMN
- DMT reduces DMN integrity acutely
- Effects correlate with subjective ego dissolution

**Therapeutic Implications**
- DMN hyperconnectivity in depression
- "Resetting" rigid self-referential patterns
- Window for therapeutic intervention
- New perspectives on self possible

### Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor

#### Receptor Biology
- G-protein coupled receptor
- Dense in cortical layer V pyramidal neurons
- Also in claustrum, limbic structures
- Mediates primary psychedelic effects

**Psychedelic Binding**
- Classical psychedelics are 5-HT2A agonists/partial agonists
- Binding affinity correlates with subjective potency
- Ketanserin (antagonist) blocks psychedelic effects
- Head-twitch response in rodents as behavioral correlate

**Downstream Effects**
- Glutamate release in prefrontal cortex
- Altered thalamocortical signaling
- Increased excitability of cortical neurons
- Changes in gene expression (BDNF, Arc, plasticity genes)

**Biased Agonism**
- Different psychedelics activate different signaling pathways
- May explain phenomenological differences
- Beta-arrestin vs. Gq signaling
- Implications for drug development

### Increased Neural Entropy

#### Measurement Approaches
**Lempel-Ziv Complexity**
- Signal diversity measure
- Higher during psychedelic states
- Correlates with subjective intensity

**Sample Entropy**
- Time series irregularity
- Increased under psychedelics
- Predictive of subjective effects

**Repertoire of Brain States**
- Psychedelics increase number of accessible states
- More diverse neural configurations
- "Broadening" of consciousness

#### Interpretation
**Entropic Brain Hypothesis**
- Normal consciousness: constrained, low entropy
- Psychedelic state: unconstrained, high entropy
- Therapeutic: disrupting overly constrained patterns

**REBUS Model Refinement**
- Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics
- Reduced precision of prior beliefs
- Allows belief revision and updating
- Integrates predictive processing framework

### Connectivity Changes

#### Global Connectivity
**Increased Between-Network Communication**
- Networks that normally don't communicate
- Visual-auditory cross-talk (synesthesia mechanism)
- Breakdown of modular organization

**Thalamocortical Dysconnectivity**
- Reduced thalamic gating function
- More information reaches cortex
- Sensory flooding

#### Specific Pathway Changes
**Claustrum**
- Highly connected "hub" structure
- Dense 5-HT2A expression
- May coordinate consciousness
- Reduced activity during psychedelic states

**Parahippocampal-PFC Connectivity**
- Memory-executive function communication altered
- May underlie time distortion
- Autobiographical memory access changed

**Visual Cortex**
- Increased excitability
- Altered feedback connectivity
- May explain visual phenomena

### Neuroplasticity Effects

#### Acute Plasticity
**Structural Changes**
- Increased dendritic spine density (rodent studies)
- Enhanced neurite outgrowth
- Similar to ketamine's effects
- Rapid onset (within hours)

**Molecular Mechanisms**
- BDNF upregulation
- mTOR pathway activation
- TrkB receptor signaling
- Immediate early gene expression

#### Sustained Plasticity
**Long-Term Potentiation Enhancement**
- Enhanced synaptic strengthening
- May underlie lasting therapeutic effects
- "Window of plasticity" for learning

**Default Mode Network Remodeling**
- Potentially lasting changes in DMN function
- New patterns of connectivity
- Flexibility in self-referential processing

**Therapeutic Window**
- Integration period crucial
- New neural patterns can be consolidated
- Therapy during plasticity window may enhance outcomes

#### Non-Hallucinogenic Analogs
- Tabernanthalog (TBG): neuroplasticity without hallucinogenesis
- AAZ-A-154: similar approach
- May isolate therapeutic mechanisms
- Questions about whether experience is necessary

### Additional Neuroscience Topics

#### Glutamate System
- Psychedelics increase glutamate release
- Prefrontal cortex particularly affected
- May drive downstream effects
- Connection to ketamine's mechanisms

#### Inflammatory Effects
- Anti-inflammatory properties documented
- TNF-alpha, IL-6 reductions
- Potential for inflammatory conditions
- Mechanism may contribute to therapeutic effects

#### Neuroimaging Findings Summary
| Substance | Key Finding | Brain Region |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Psilocybin | Decreased activity | Default mode network |
| LSD | Increased connectivity | Global |
| DMT | Reduced alpha power | Posterior cortex |
| Ketamine | Increased glutamate | Prefrontal cortex |
| MDMA | Amygdala deactivation | Limbic system |
